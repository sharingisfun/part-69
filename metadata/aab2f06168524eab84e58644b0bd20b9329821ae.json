You want answers? Here they are. You may NOT like what is coming for USa.\n\nDescription:\n\nLeadership in Praise and Worship: Learning From Past Mistakes\nBrian S. Neumann\nThe world of the professional rock/pop music industry was my life and existence for\n16 years. I worked in South Africa and Europe as a composer, live performer, and session\nmusician, and, for a time, was signed to the company Polydor Records in Hamburg, Germany.\nThankfully though, the Lord, by His grace, finally brought me to my senses and rescued me\nfrom a situation that nearly cost me not only my temporal, but also eternal life.\nFrom the day I gave my life to Jesus, I began intensive research into the language of\nmusicÃ¢â‚¬â€from a musicological, physiological, psychological, and Biblical perspective. The\nissue of music and worship became the focus of my study, and soon a ministry developed that\nnow takes me to countries around the world, where I share a Bible-centered understanding of\nthis vital issue.\n\n\n\n\nThis is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.\n\nThese Torrents are currently on a Free Leech --  High Speed Server\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aab2f06168524eab84e58644b0bd20b9329821ae","amp;dn":"POtHS+2+-+Bible+Study+-+Part+97+-+Changes+by+Brain+Neumann","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aab2f06168524eab84e58644b0bd20b9329821ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,178,240,97,104,82,78,171,132,229,134,68,176,189,32,185,50,152,33,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
