It's been just over three years since\nErES was established and in that time in the scene we've produced many\nquality releases because of our attitude not only as a group -- but as\nindividuals; each member of the group has shown respect and friendship\nand in return offers loyalty that could only be found when part of a\ntight-knit family. We are not a release machine and never intend to be.\nWe have a relaxed, yet hard-working attitude towards producing releases\nand you can see this through all of our current (and future) releases.\n\nIf you feel ErES is a family that you want to be part of\nwe have listed below the currently open positions and things we\nrequire:\n\nExperienced reversers for all Operating Systems;\nSkilled coders;\nQuality suppliers;\nGood 100Mbit+ EU &amp; Asia Sites to affil with;\nAnything else you think we might like!\n\ne r e s g r p  a t  g m a i l . c o m\n\nascii/nfo:...........ph0!SiLK    updated:............16.04.2010\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc9c4e75e95b42743c6ed71195c01af7afa72183","amp;dn":"XYplorer.v10.50.0000.Cracked-ErES","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc9c4e75e95b42743c6ed71195c01af7afa72183","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,156,78,117,233,91,66,116,60,110,215,17,149,192,26,247,175,167,33,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
