Along the way heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll devise entertaining scientific experiments which will in turn explain the extraordinary workings of each of these phenomenal creaturesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ specific capabilities.\n\nRichard also meets scientists and engineers who have transferred these extraordinary talents to modern technology, from a state-of-the-art suit for jet pilots to withstand higher G-force, to a water-repelling substance to apply to everyday objects, including a mobile phone and a tailored suit.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:228cc72636d3fec27de48e7b801d31aa0ecec091","amp;dn":"Richard+Hammond%27s+Miracles+of+Nature+S01E01","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"228cc72636d3fec27de48e7b801d31aa0ecec091","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,140,199,38,54,211,254,194,125,228,142,123,128,29,49,170,14,206,192,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
