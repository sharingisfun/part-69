I'm uploading this because all the other copies of X-Plane 9 I've found on TPB are all modified in some way.\nThis is Disk 1, which contains the program itself with the USA scenery (plus a sliver of Canada and Mexico). The version is 9.00r1, which is the very first release. You can update it using the updater from http://x-plane.com/pg_downloads.html\nNOTE: This does NOT contain the installer for Macintosh or Linux. If you want to use this on anything other than windows you will need to download the appropriate installers from http://wiki.x-plane.com/DVD_Installers then use the updater to download/patch the OS specific files not contained on the DVD.\n\n---\n\nISO image made using CloneCD. You can find the additional Global Scenery DVDs around TPB by other uploaders.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72eeb42823a6c5d8248e86817e5839a157c59627","amp;dn":"X-Plane+9+-+Disk+1+%5BExact+copy+of+retail+DVD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72eeb42823a6c5d8248e86817e5839a157c59627","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,238,180,40,35,166,197,216,36,142,134,129,126,88,57,161,87,197,150,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
