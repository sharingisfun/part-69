(Those two temples have temple workers act out the endowment ceremony instead of showing a movie in those two temples.) \n\n\nMormons believe they must wear special underwear (which can only be purchased in special Mormon Church owned stores) and learn secret Masonic handshakes in order to go to Heaven. \n\nTake special note of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Law of ConsecrationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that is at the 58:40 mark. Mitt Romney has sworn to obey this oath countless times. Do you really want the President of the United States to be a man who has sworn to Ã¢â‚¬Å“consecrateÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ all of his Ã¢â‚¬Å“time, talents and everything with which the Lord has blessed him with or with which he WILL BE blessed withÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to the Mormon Church?!?!\n\nIt seems to me that THAT oath might conflict with the oath of office.\n\n---\n\nRipped from YouTube.
