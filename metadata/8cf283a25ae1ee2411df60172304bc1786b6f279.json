The band's latest album will almost certainly expand\ntheir audience through a more thematically varied repertoire, without\nsacrificing any of their usual euphoric momentum. Led Bib sounds like a\nheavy-metal guitar group on the opening Moth Dilemma, with Toby McLaren's keys\nlaying fuzz-chords under the alto saxes of Chris Williams and Pete Grogan, as\nthe piece builds to a frenetic funkiness. Sometimes, a single sax will toy with\na staccato free-jazz motif, sometimes hooting electronic sounds shadow brusque\nmelody. Hollow-wind noises curl round horror-movie themes and Liran Donin's\nacoustic bass unfolds bluesy figures that are greeted by breathy sax lines and\nrising horn harmonies. The set starts with punchy grooving and ends on the\ncymbal shivers and wistful melodies of the closing Winter Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and if Bring Your\nOwn was intended to summarise where this energetic group has been and might\nstill go, it succeeds admirably.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8cf283a25ae1ee2411df60172304bc1786b6f279","amp;dn":"Led+Bib+-+Bring+Your+Own+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8cf283a25ae1ee2411df60172304bc1786b6f279","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,242,131,162,90,225,238,36,17,223,96,23,35,4,188,23,134,182,242,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
