Can we think about our collective as well as our private interests? And, can we think long-term as well as short-term?\n\nDrawing from the broad arena of commercial imagery, and utilizing sophisticated graphics, Advertising &amp; the End of the World addresses the issues these questions raise, encouraging viewers to reflect on their own participation in the culture of consumption.  Making the connection between society's high-consumption lifestyle and the coming environmental crisis, Jhally forces us to evaluate the physical and material costs of the consumer society and how long we can maintain our present level of production.\n\n\n2012 Enlightenment Will Lead the World to Genocide:\nSince the early days of the 2012 theories when David Wilcock was channeling an entity named Ã¢â‚¬Å“RaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ people were told that 2012 was really all about enlightenment.
