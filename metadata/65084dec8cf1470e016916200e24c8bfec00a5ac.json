Vaughn\nIllustrated &amp; Colored by Vincent Spencer\n\nZombie-Proof is a three-issue, bi-monthly mini-series written by J.C. Vaughn and illustrated by Vincent Spencer, who teamed up after meeting last July. When they found out they had a fondness for zombies in common, Zombie-Proof came together quickly. Vaughn is the writer of 24 from IDW Publishing (based on the hit Fox show) and has written or co-written Billy TucciÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Shi for the past six years. He is also the creator of Antiques: The Comic Strip, which has run in Antique Trader. His work has been featured in TV Guide, Emmy Magazine, Wizard, and 24 Magazine, and other publications. He is the Executive Editor and Associate Publisher of Gemstone Publishing, home of The Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide, The EC Archives, Scoop, and Disney comics.\n\nThe zombies are coming.\n\nBilly Bob Driwahl, the only locksmith in the isolated town of San Rosina in far west Texas, knows theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re coming.\n\nIn fact, he's known since before he graduated high school 20 years ago. His mistake might have been trying to tell people. Since then, the town's been divided into two groups. There are the folks who think heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plain crazy, and there are the other folks who think heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plain crazy but realize that he does good work and is, after all, the only locksmith in town.\n\nThen the civilized world starts to collapse. What happens to the good old boys in this rural town when the big cities are tearing themselves to pieces? Zombie-Proof has the answers. And some of them are sort of funny.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65084dec8cf1470e016916200e24c8bfec00a5ac","amp;dn":"Zombie+Proof+%231-3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65084dec8cf1470e016916200e24c8bfec00a5ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,8,77,236,140,241,71,14,1,105,22,32,14,36,200,191,236,0,165,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
