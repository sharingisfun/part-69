The self is the universe, the self is the alpha and omega, god, and infinity, and thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the only thing that evolves because we are all part of the self. Nothing goes through an evolutionary process alone or without direct benefit to the whole. So when you begin to think that thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s this controlling elite, this controlling hand behind the curtains leading the planet to destructionÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nWhen you think the end is near, the apocalypse, Armageddon, and when you think we as a species are doomed, it is not they, it is you that brought this about, and for a very good reason. You are evolving. Stop blaming everybody and everything else. Quit panicking about global tyranny and natural disaster and pay attention, because the world is telling you something; itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tell you exactly what is wrong with you and how to fix it.&quot;\n\n\nPlease share and seed.
