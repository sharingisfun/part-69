Here I have included all those files that I have been able to find on internet till now about schizophrenia, psychosis, its theory and therapy. This torrent would specially be of great help to those who are doing either research in schizophrenia or are treating schizophrenic patients. \n\nI may have missed many files, so if you know of any file please tell me, I will search for them and will try adding them separately. \n\nIn this torrent only e-books have been added. I will add a torrent soon containing research articles about the same from various perspectives so that diverse material can be made available here and can be shared among researchers and practitioners from different fields. There are many out there who are engaged in life-long efforts to understand this illness (?).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83500ed611ec96080382630642285eba2ff9bdd4","amp;dn":"books","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83500ed611ec96080382630642285eba2ff9bdd4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,80,14,214,17,236,150,8,3,130,99,6,66,40,94,186,47,249,189,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
