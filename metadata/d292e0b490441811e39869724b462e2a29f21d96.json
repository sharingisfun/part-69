It's an exciting and creative concept that addresses the insights gleaned from our research in a very innovative way, adding that the animations would create a more demographically accessible face for McLaren.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d292e0b490441811e39869724b462e2a29f21d96","amp;dn":"McLaren+Animation+Tooned+Episode+7+The+Rising+Son.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d292e0b490441811e39869724b462e2a29f21d96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,146,224,180,144,68,24,17,227,152,105,114,75,70,46,42,41,242,29,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
