Back in Bundle #38, I raised the question if I should continue or not.  Surprisingly, one person responded.  So I think I'll torrent this 41st bundle today, then wait until 2013 to decide if I want to do this all over again for a third year in a row.\n\nLet's do a little math.  Up to my 40th bundle, I had shared 1042 releases on the year.  Then rzrshiv kindly pointed out that I needed to subtract five for duplication.  And now today's 41st bundle contains 30 more titles.  So that's 1042 - 5 + 30 = 1067 releases for 2012!\n\nHopefully this 41st bundle has something for everyone.  If you like hip-hop, then you're covered with Christon Gray or even Erica Cumbo's much anticipated &quot;Beauty For Ashes&quot; album.  If Christian Blues is your preference, then how about Lurrie Bell, John Pearson, or even Joe Louis Walker?  Looking for some Gospel today?  I've got that covered too with Leandria Johnson's &quot;The Experience&quot; album.  Southern Gospel?  The Oak Ridge Boys.  R&amp;B?  Ruth Noemi.  Or maybe you're looking for some Bluegrass?  Look no further than &quot;The Rough Guide To Bluegrass&quot; by Various Artists.  Christian Rock?  There's plenty of it here.  Some that come to mind is Needtobreathe's new EP, Abel, Kronicles, etc.  Some metal perhaps?  Tsavo Inc should take care of that.  Contemporary?  Mark Schultz!  Worship?  Jadon Lavik, Mike Kim, and Wordology.\n\nSpecifically, the 30 titles in this 41th bundle today include...\n\n * Abel - 2012 - Make It Right\n * Christon Gray - 2012 - Body Art\n * Cities Under Fire - 2012 - Bright Lights\n * Dawson Cowals - 2012 - Thank You - A Military Tribute - Single\n * Don Byron - 2012 - Love Peace And Soul\n * E-Flat - 2012 - Down From Heaven\n * Erica Cumbo - 2012 - Beauty For Ashes\n * Jadon Lavik - 2012 - Roots Run Deep(er)\n * Janice Gaines - 2012 - One Day - Single\n * Jericho Road Worship - 2012 - The Glory Of Your Name - Single\n * Joe Louis Walker - 2012 - Hellfire\n * John Pearson - 2012 - Grasshoppers In My Pillow\n * Joshua - 2012 - The Outsiders\n * Kronicles - 2012 - Illuminate EP\n * Leandria Johnson - 2012 - The Experience\n * Lecrae - 2012 - Finally Free - DJ Love Killed Kurt Presents\n * Lurrie Bell - 2012 - The Devil Ain't Got No Music\n * Mark Schultz - 2012 - All Things Possible\n * Mike Kim - 2012 - Greatly To Be Praised\n * Needtobreathe - 2012 - Keep Your Eyes Open EP\n * Nonparell - 2012 - Heaven Come Down\n * Oak Ridge Boys - 2012 - Back Home Again\n * Ray Wylie Hubbard - 2012 - The Grifters Hymnal\n * Ruth Noemi - 2012 - Deeply In Love With You - Single\n * Ruth Noemi - 2012 - Perfect Love - Single\n * Ruth Noemi - 2012 - Temporary - Single\n * Terry Scott Taylor - 2012 - Return To The Neverhood\n * Tsavo Inc - 2012 - When The Lions Are Hungry\n * Various - 2012 - The Rough Guide To Bluegrass\n * Wordology - 2012 - Bible Songs For Kids\n\nGod Bless,\nTorrentTracts - September 2012\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c868c5ebe775d293e2de24e242205329add78be9","amp;dn":"2012+-+The+Year+In+Christian+Music+%28Bundle+41+of+41%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c868c5ebe775d293e2de24e242205329add78be9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,104,197,235,231,117,210,147,226,222,36,226,66,32,83,41,173,215,139,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
