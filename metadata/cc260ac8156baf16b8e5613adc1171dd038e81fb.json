It essentially turns the Quake Live website into an application that is directly launched from the user's desktop rather than indirectly from a traditional web browser. This application combines the Quake Live website, a modified version of Mozilla Lab's Prism and several custom scripts written by members of the Quake Live community to enable users to quickly and effortlessly experience Quake Live with many additional useful features. QLPrism is currently available for Windows and Linux.\n\nOfficial Website: http://www.qlprism.us/ ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc260ac8156baf16b8e5613adc1171dd038e81fb","amp;dn":"QLPrism%3A+A+community-driven+launcher+for+Quake+Live+%28Linux+64-bi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc260ac8156baf16b8e5613adc1171dd038e81fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,38,10,200,21,107,175,22,184,229,97,58,220,17,113,221,3,142,129,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
