I've added it in text format and JDownloader DLC. I'm recommending to use JDownloader or download with premium. It took me month to download two DVD's.\n\nNow available is season 2 and 3 (with that links). I've added also links to season 1 DVD 3 and 4 if you want to download it faster than me. It's my source and I'll upload DVD 3 and 4 ASAP.\n\nI will not upload season 2 and 3! If you want, you should organise yourself, download it once and share as torrent or other easier sharing type than turbobit.\n\nI hope you enjoy that \nThis is only version with english subtitles!\n\n\n\n\nGeneral\nFormat: DVD Video\nFile size: 32.0 KiB\nDuration: 48mn 31s\nOverall bit rate mode: Variable\nOverall bit rate: 90 bps\n\nVideo\nFormat: MPEG Video\nDuration: 48mn 31s\nBit rate mode: Variable\nWidth: 720 pixels\nHeight: 576 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio: 16:9\nFrame rate: 25.000 fps\n\nAudio\nFormat: AC-3\nFormat/Info: Audio Coding 3\nDuration: 48mn 31s\nChannel(s): 6 channels\nSampling rate: 48.0 KHz\nLanguage: Polish\n\nText #1\nFormat: RLE\nFormat/Info: Run-length encoding\nBit depth: 2 bits\nLanguage: Polish\n\nText #2\nFormat: RLE\nFormat/Info: Run-length encoding\nBit depth: 2 bits\nLanguage: English\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e093a445a69fff0ab653d80adbb81e35d33dbf1d","amp;dn":"Czas+Honoru-Time%2FDays+of+Honor-Season+1+ENG+PL+DVD9+1%2B2+-+Waldek","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e093a445a69fff0ab653d80adbb81e35d33dbf1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,147,164,69,166,159,255,10,182,83,216,10,219,184,30,53,211,61,191,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
