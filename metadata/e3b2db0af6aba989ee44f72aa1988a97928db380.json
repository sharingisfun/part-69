ISCARIOT, her highly-anticipated novel of Judas, the infamous betrayer of Christ, releases February 2013.\n\nTosca received her B.A. in English and International Relations from Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts. She also studied at Oxford University. In her spare time, Tosca enjoys adventure travel and makes her home in the midwest.\n\nTitles\n\n1. Havah - Myth and legend shroud her in mystery. Now hear her story. From paradise to exile, from immortality to the death of Adam, experience the dawn of mankind through the eyes of Eve, the woman first known... as Havah.\n\n2. Iscariot - Based on extensive research into the life and times of Judas Iscariot, this triumph of fiction storytelling by the author of Havah: The Story of Eve revisits one of biblical historyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most maligned figures and brings the world he inhabited vividly to life. In Jesus, Judas believes he has found the OneÃ¢â‚¬â€the promised Messiah and future king of the Jews, destined to overthrow Roman rule. Galvanized, he joins the NazareneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s followers, ready to enact the change he has waited for all his life. But soon JudasÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vision of a nation free from Rome is crushed by the inexplicable actions of the Nazarene himself, who will not bow to social or religious conventionÃ¢â‚¬â€who seems, in the end, to even turn against his own people. At last, Judas must confront the fact that the master he loves is not the liberator he hoped for, but a man bent on a drastically different agenda. Iscariot is the story of Judas, from his tumultuous childhood to his emergence as the man known to the world as the betrayer of Jesus. But even more, it is a singular and surprising view into the life of Jesus that forces us to reexamine everything we thought we knew about the most famousÃ¢â‚¬â€and infamousÃ¢â‚¬â€religious icons in history.\n\n3. Demon - Recently divorced and mired in a meaningless existence, Clay drifts from his drab apartment to his equally lusterless job as an editor for a small Boston press--until the night Lucian finds him and everything changes with the simple words, &quot;I'm going to tell you my story, and you're going to write it down and publish it.&quot;What begins as a mystery soon spirals into chaotic obsession as Clay struggles to piece together Lucian's dark tale of love, ambition, and grace--only to discover that the demon's story has become his own. And then only one thing matters: learning how the story ends.\n\n---\n\nDRM free and may contain Advanced Reader Copies (ARC)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3b2db0af6aba989ee44f72aa1988a97928db380","amp;dn":"Tosca+Lee+%28var+formats%2FARC%29+-+spanikopita","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3b2db0af6aba989ee44f72aa1988a97928db380","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,178,219,10,246,171,169,137,238,68,247,42,161,152,138,151,146,141,179,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
