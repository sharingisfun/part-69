In this workshop author and expert Tim Grey shares techniques for bringing old photos to life, from fixing torn or otherwise damaged areas of a photo to improving the level of detail to adding color where it didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t exist before. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how to work nondestructively so you never lose important information and how to save your master image with layers intact so you can make more changes down the line.
