In order to ease his pain, he asks his long-time best friend and ex-con, Alex, to kill him. Alex reluctantly agrees to give Jim his wish, but he doesn't think its a good idea to do the job down in LA. So Jim and Alex begin their journey with a trip up to Jim's Aunt's cabin in the mountains, under the strict condition that all business is to be taken care of before Valentine's Day.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87491b30f6f14c1e499db4af1716174acffe9bd1","amp;dn":"Asian+Stories+%282006%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87491b30f6f14c1e499db4af1716174acffe9bd1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,73,27,48,246,241,76,30,73,157,180,175,23,22,23,74,207,254,155,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
