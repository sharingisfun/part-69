Notoriously detail-attentive, hearing fresh Glitch Mob reminds just how much they can pack into their productions while keeping each sonic element unadulterated and focused--tack-sharp engineering, right here.\n\nAs the follow-up to 2010's massively popular Drink The Sea, Love Death Immortality will quench the resulting thirst from all that ocean water with more mouth-watering music in addition to Can't Kill Us when it sees an official release Feb. 11 on Glass Air Records.\n\nEnjoy the track below, along with the visuals directed by beeple, which are a nice fit for the nightmarishly powerful composition.
