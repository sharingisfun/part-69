The director Luigi Bazzoni ( chose to ditch the opera, go back to Prosper Merimee's original novella - and shoot it in the style of a Spaghetti Western!\n\nBazzoni's camerawork is more frenetic than inventive, and his film never quite works. Still, it does boast a wondrous cast. Franco Nero, blue eyes blazing in his dark-bronzed face, is the naive young soldier Jose. Klaus Kinski, teeth gnashing and lips curling in his usual manner, is the sadistic bandit Garcia. And lovely Tina Aumont enjoys a rare leading role as Carmen - the amoral and seductive gypsy who drags both men to their doom.\n\nAumont may not be the world's greatest actress. (In fact, she can barely act at all!) But like her mother, Maria 'Cobra Woman' Montez, she seems to have the words FEMME FATALE emblazoned in bright scarlet letters across her forehead. Her enormous dark eyes are wells of untold depravity. Her pouting, voluptuous mouth would lure any man to his ruin. If you remember anything in this film, it will be her.\n\n\n[b]Idioma do Ãƒï¿½udio: [/b]Italiano\n[b]IMDB: \n\n[/b][url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062424/]http:\n\n\nb]Qualidade de VÃƒÂ­deo: [/b]DVD Rip\n[b]VÃƒÂ­deo Codec: [/b]XviD\n[b]VÃƒÂ­deo Bitrate: [/b]890 Kbps\n[b]Ãƒï¿½udio Codec: [/b]MPEG1/2 L3\n[b]Ãƒï¿½udio Bitrate: [/b]121 kbps  48 KHz\n[b]ResoluÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o: [/b]608 x 304\n[b]Aspect Ratio: [/b]2.000\n[b]Formato de Tela: [/b]Outros\n[b]Frame Rate: [/b]29.970 FPS\n[b]Tamanho: [/b]698.9 MiB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32196f089d4945f4f4cec3b96a2d4fcc859bdd19","amp;dn":"L%27uomo%2C+l%27orgoglio%2C+la+vendetta+%28Django+nao+perdoa%2C+mata%2C+1968%29%2C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32196f089d4945f4f4cec3b96a2d4fcc859bdd19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,25,111,8,157,73,69,244,244,206,195,185,106,45,79,204,133,155,221,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
