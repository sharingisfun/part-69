However, this one sounds nice, \nespecially when he through in 'Johnny B.Goode'.  I don't usually see him\nperforming this during his shows.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5490b9c82e7d2a10136435ec7c55bf8547065e1","amp;dn":"Jimi+Hendrix+-+1970-05-30+-+Berkeley+Comm+Theatre+in+Berkely%2C+CA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5490b9c82e7d2a10136435ec7c55bf8547065e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,73,11,156,130,231,210,161,1,54,67,94,199,197,91,248,84,112,101,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
