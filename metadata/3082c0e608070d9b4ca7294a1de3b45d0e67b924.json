Usually, 7-Zip compresses to 7z format 30-70% better than to zip format. High compression ratio in new 7z format with LZMA compression. Supported formats - Packing / unpacking: 7z, ZIP, GZIP, BZIP2 and TAR. Unpacking only: 7z, ZIP, RAR, GZIP, GZ, BZIP2, BZ2, TAR, CAB, ISO, ARJ, LZH, LHA, CHM, MSI, WIM, Z, CPIO, RPM, DEB, CPIO, DMG, FAT, HFS, LZMA, NTFS, SPLIT, SWM, TAZ, TBZ, TBZ2, TGZ, TPZ, VHD, XAR, XZ, Z and NSIS. For ZIP and GZIP formats, 7-Zip provides a compression ratio that is 2-10 % better than the ratio provided by PKZip and WinZip. Self-extracting capability for 7z format. Integration with Windows Shell. Powerful File Manager. Localizations for 70 languages.\n\nPowerful command line version\nPlugin for FAR Manager\n7-Zip works in Windows 98/ME/NT/2000/XP/Vista. There is a port of the command line version to Linux/Unix.\nCompression ratio results are very dependent upon the data used for the tests.\n\nThe main features of 7z format:\nOpen architecture\nHigh compression ratio\nStrong AES-256 encryption\nAbility to use any compression, conversion or encryption method\nSupports files with sizes up to 16000000000 GB\nUnicode file names\nSolid compression\nArchive header compression\n\n7z has an open architecture, so it can support any new compression method, too. The following methods currently are integrated into 7z:\nLZMA - Improved and optimized version of LZ77 algorithm\nPPMD - Dmitry Shkarin's PPMdH with small changes\nBCJ - Converter for 32-bit x86 executables\nBCJ2 - Converter for 32-bit x86 executables\nBZip2 - Standard BWT algorithm\nDeflate - Standard LZ77-based algorithm\n\nLZMA is the default and general compression method of 7z format. The main features of LZMA are:\nHigh compression ratio\nVariable dictionary size (up to 4 GB)\nCompression speed: about 1 MB/s on 2 GHz CPU\nDecompression speed: about 10-20 MB/s on 2 GHz CPU\nSmall memory requirement for decompression (depend from dictionary size)\nSmall code size for decompression: about 5 KB\nSupports multi-threading and P4's hyper-threading","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3082c0e608070d9b4ca7294a1de3b45d0e67b924","amp;dn":"7-Zip+9.30+Alpha","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3082c0e608070d9b4ca7294a1de3b45d0e67b924","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,130,192,230,8,7,13,155,76,167,41,74,29,227,180,93,14,103,185,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
