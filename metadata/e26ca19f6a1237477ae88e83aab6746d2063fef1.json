It began as a science-fiction anthology that served as a showcase for such artists as Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko, and featured superheroes during the period fans and historians call, The Silver Age of Comic Books.  It became The Incredible Hulk with issue 102 (April, 1968).  The sister title of Tales To Astonish was Tales of Suspense. &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7602586/Tales_Of_Suspense_(Complete)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7602586/Tales_Of_Suspense_(Complete)&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe early run of the first volume of Tales to Astonish ran from issues 1 through 34 (January, 1959 to August, 1962,) initially under Atlas Comics (the 1950s forerunner of Marvel) and fell under the Marvel banner with issue 21 (July, 1961.)  The first with a cover sporting the early MC box.  It contained science-fiction/mystery/suspense stories written primarily by editor-in-chief, Stan Lee, and his brother, Larry Lieber, with artists including Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko, Dick Ayers, Don Heck and Paul Reinman.  One such story, The Man In The Ant Hill, in issue 27 (January, 1962,) introduced the character Henry Pym, who would be repurposed eight issues later as the superhero Ant-Man.  Anthological stories continued to appear as backups until Tales to Astonish became a superhero split book in 1964, when it began featuring one story each of Giant-Man and The Hulk.\n\nThe Hulk (whose original series, The Incredible Hulk, had been canceled after a six-issue run in 1962 to 1963) returned to star in his own feature when Tales to Astonish became a split book at issue 60 (October, 1964,) after having guest-starred as Giant-Man's antagonist in a full-length story the previous issue.  The Hulk had proven a popular guest-star in three issues of Fantastic Four, and an issue of The Amazing Spider-Man.  His new stories here were initially scripted by Lee and illustrated by the seldom-seen team of penciler Steve Ditko and inker George Roussos.  This early part of the Hulk saga introduced The Leader (who would become the arch-nemesis of The Hulk) and popularized this now huge, green, superhero icon.  The final issue of Tales to Astonish was issue 101.  TTA became the solo magazine The Incredible Hulk with issue 102 (April, 1968.)  ALL 101 issues of this Volume 1 are included in this torrent.\n\nA second volume of Tales To Astonish, starring the Sub-Mariner, ran 14 issues (December, 1979 through January, 1981,) reprinted edited versions of Sub-Mariner 1-14 (May, 1968 through June, 1969.)  All but the last issue ran 18 page versions of the originally 20 page stories, with panels and text reworked to condense the plot.  That last issue also included three Sub-Mariner pinups, one by character creator Bill Everett (reprinted from Marvel Mystery Comics 9 (July, 1940;)) one by penciler Jack Kirby and inker Sol Brodsky (reprinted from Fantastic Four 33 (December, 1964;)) and a new one by artist Alan Weiss.  Covers repurposed the original art, with the premiere issue's image flipped 180 degrees.  None of these issues are included in this torrent.  (I will create a Sub-Mariner torrent upon request.)\n\nTales To Astonish Volume 3, Number 1 (December, 1994) was a 72 page, square bound, one-shot special starring:  The Hulk; The Sub-Mariner; Ant-Man; and The Wasp, in the story, Loki's Dream, by writer Peter David, with painted art by John Estes.  This torrent does includes this issue.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e26ca19f6a1237477ae88e83aab6746d2063fef1","amp;dn":"Tales+To+Astonish","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e26ca19f6a1237477ae88e83aab6746d2063fef1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,108,161,159,106,18,55,71,122,232,142,131,170,182,116,109,32,99,254,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
