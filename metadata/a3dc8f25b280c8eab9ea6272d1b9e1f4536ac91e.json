Genevieve takes the young girl home but is afraid to leave her alone. When Celine's stepmother offers the nurse money to take care of her stepdaughter, Genevieve agrees. A bond forms between the young girl and older woman until one day Genevieve realizes Celine has uncanny healing powers. With its dream-like cinematography and haunting music, Jean-Claude Brisseau's psychological drama is a lyrical tale of miracles, apparitions, and sainthood. Brisseau, a maverick director unafraid to tackle social and cultural issues, combines naturalism and surrealism in his own distinctive style. \n\nIncluded a preface for the film by Philippe Le Guay.\n\nLanguage: French\nSubtitle included: English (.sub and .srt)\nResolution: 640x480\nSize: 1.084 Gb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3dc8f25b280c8eab9ea6272d1b9e1f4536ac91e","amp;dn":"C%26eacute%3Bline+%28Jean-Claude+Brisseau%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3dc8f25b280c8eab9ea6272d1b9e1f4536ac91e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,220,143,37,178,128,200,234,185,234,98,114,209,185,225,244,83,106,201,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
