It tells the story of an investment banker who is given a mysterious gift: participation in a game that integrates in strange ways with his life. As the lines between the banker's real life and the game become more uncertain, hints of a large conspiracy become apparent.\nThe Game was well received by critics like Roger Ebert and major periodicals like The New York Times, though Leonard Maltin found the film &quot;unusually mean-spirited&quot; and lacking a sense of humor.[1] The Game had middling box-office returns compared to the success of Fincher's previous film, Seven. The scene in which protagonist Van Orton finds a life sized clown doll in his driveway was ranked #44 on Bravo's The 100 Scariest Movie Moments.\n\nhave fun and enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8af9b1f55a527146dfbcfb68365944f275443876","amp;dn":"The+Game+1997","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8af9b1f55a527146dfbcfb68365944f275443876","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,249,177,245,90,82,113,70,223,188,251,104,54,89,68,242,117,68,56,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
