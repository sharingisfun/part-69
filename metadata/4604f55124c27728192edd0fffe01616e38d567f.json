There is truth here for all ages and beliefs. If Darwin was wrong...........then the Schools have been intentionally lying to our Children. \nDescription\n\nOrigins - Making the Case for Creation with Ron Rhodes:\nRon Rhodes makes the Case for Creation via the fossil record, lack of intermediate forms &amp; the retarded theory of punctuated equilibrium to compensate for that lack of evidence, along with DNA, mutations natural selection and intelligent design.\n\n\n\nWhat is truth by Chuck Missler:\nThis is the classic question that Pilate posed rhetorically ...and rather cynically. And the very existence of truth is continuing to be trampled by pompous professors, prostituted politicians, and arrogant attorneys. Now with the blockbuster movie, The Da Vinci Code, promoting blasphemous heresies about the embodiment of Truth itself, we canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t escape this skillfully coordinated attack against those who take truth seriously. Yet, the pursuit of truth is our most critical of endeavors and upon which our eternal destiny rests.\n\n\nGod and the Problem of Evil by Charlie Campbell:\n\nWhat is Truth by Doug Bachelor:\n\n\nThis is dedicated to my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.\n\n\nThe Entire Collection can be found here: \n\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\n\n:thankyou:    :thankyou:     Thank You JESUS  \n\n\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4604f55124c27728192edd0fffe01616e38d567f","amp;dn":"POtHS+-+Creation+-+48+-+Our+Created+Universe%2C+Origins+and+What+I","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4604f55124c27728192edd0fffe01616e38d567f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,4,245,81,36,194,119,40,25,46,221,15,255,224,22,22,227,141,86,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
