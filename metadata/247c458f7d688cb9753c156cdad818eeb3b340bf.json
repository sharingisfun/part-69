This is Ago GamesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ first release into the gaming world, and with it they hoped to bring back the feel of the classic beat-ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢em-up like River City Ransom or Renegade, but with a new thematic direction ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ along with that classic arcade-style game play comes some comedy and an interesting story line.\n\nThe Asskickers is not without its faults, but as a first release I wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t expecting perfection. Before we get into its problems letÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s take a look at some of the stuff that was enjoyable about this first outing.\n\nThis style of the beat-ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢em-up game is hardly seen anymore, especially when it comes to PC and Mac releases. I was reminded of some of the games I used to play at the arcade as a child, which IMHO is always a good thing; itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s got classic cartoon-sounding punching, grunting, and kicking sounds as well as a fitting soundtrack that really adds to the whole throwback vibe AGO was going for. It also offers co-op mode that unlocks new dialogues as well as extra powerful dual attacks, which proved rather fun to test out.\n\n\nRecommended System Requirements\n\n*OS: Windows XP/ Windows Vista/ Windows 7\n*Processor: Intel Pentium D 3.0GHz / AMD Athlon LE-1660\n*Memory Ram: 2 GB\n*Hard Disk Space: 2.5 GB\n*Video: nVidia GeForce 7800 GT / ATI Radeon X800 XT\n*Sound Card: DirectX Compatible\n*DirectX: 9\n*Keyboard / Mouse\n*Installation: DVD-Rom Drive","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:247c458f7d688cb9753c156cdad818eeb3b340bf","amp;dn":"The+Asskickers+Portable+-+%5BEspera%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"247c458f7d688cb9753c156cdad818eeb3b340bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,124,69,143,125,104,140,185,117,60,21,108,218,216,24,238,179,179,64,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
