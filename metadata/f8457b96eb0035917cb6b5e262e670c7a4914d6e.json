This has been enabled by default in the past, but is only needed for a handful of discs (e.g. Ã¢â‚¬Å“GoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, R2, Germany), and is now disabled by default.\n - Change (Blu-ray): Because of popular demand, the default Region code setting is back. Remember, if you want to remove the region lock of Blu-ray discs, you *MUST* specify the region of the *DISC*. Not of your player. Not of your country. Of the *DISC*.
