A   \n   wide variety of analytical techniques have been employed, such as         \n   various chromatographic techniques (different gas and liquid              \n   chromatography methods), an electronic nose, infrared spectroscopy and    \n   expert-panel evaluation. Several families of minor compounds, with        \n   interest as adulteration markers, have been used for method               \n   development, including tocopherols, sterols, phenolics, alcohols,         \n   proteins and others. Most methods have been enhanced by the application   \n   of multivariate chemometrics. The proposed analytical techniques are of   \n   interest to investigate fraudulent actions and practices which are        \n   detrimental to product quality.
