His one liners stand up a few times. But this is a thriller with a great twist, and there is a sequel screaming to be made. It will entertain you, I figured out what was really happening quite early, but it didn't spoil the ending, which was great. This film is certainly not produced so well, but the story carries it to the end and makes it worth the investing the run time. Can't wait for part 2, hope it out does the first, and who knows how that will end. There are flashback sequences to underline the events, and it seems that these are the weakest part, they seemed a little cardboard. Once again however, the writer deserves maximum credit for this yarn of adultery, money and deceit. Well down.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1667416/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1667416/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9132185e632f0678c3d9300969f13629505ff4a5","amp;dn":"Coffin+%282011%29%28IPOD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9132185e632f0678c3d9300969f13629505ff4a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,50,24,94,99,47,6,120,195,217,48,9,105,241,54,41,80,95,244,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
