How does the 'olde' weather lore compare with the supercomputers? And what are we doing across Britain to prepare ourselves as we head into winter?\n'Will It Snow?' predicts what another extreme cold snap would spell for Britain's economy as it puts the science of weather forecasting to the test and asks the experts what we are in store for between now and spring.\n\nBy all accounts not a very scientific programme!\n\nEnjoy,\n\nPls help seed for those interested also.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f650c1953c5bb63c48ea0be7bfbcf98b444969ec","amp;dn":"BBC-HD+Will+It+Snow+x264+AC3+720p.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f650c1953c5bb63c48ea0be7bfbcf98b444969ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,80,193,149,60,91,182,60,72,234,11,231,191,188,249,139,68,73,105,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
