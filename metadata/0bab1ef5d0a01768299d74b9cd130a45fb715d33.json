To the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœtrue believersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, he is the faithful guardian of a website devoted to the late Pete Novotnik, founder of a future-obsessed internet cult. But Miles is not a true believer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ he only got involved out of a desire to rekindle an affair with PeteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wife, Kay. Hoping to shock the true believers into a crisis of faith, he decides to reveal his true colours and his dubious role in PeteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death. But when a journalist starts to investigate, he is forced to confront the truth about his feelings for Kay and his motives for wanting to undermine the cult.\nA thought-provoking novel with flashes of dry humour, Ã¢â‚¬ËœIn the futureÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ is about jealousy, belief and the utopian dreams we project onto technology. Ã¢â‚¬ËœFluent [and] wittyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœWell written and teeming with interesting ideasÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœFantasticÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (comments by members of peer review site youwriteon). Ã¢â‚¬ËœThoughtful, intriguing and worthwhileÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (Tom Lichtenberg).\nThis book contains content considered unsuitable for young readers 17 and under, and which may be offensive to some readers of all ages.\nSeed it to keep this upload alive..","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bab1ef5d0a01768299d74b9cd130a45fb715d33","amp;dn":"In+The+Future+This+Will+Not+Be+Necessary%28Paul+Samael%29%5D%5BVectoR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bab1ef5d0a01768299d74b9cd130a45fb715d33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,171,30,245,208,160,23,104,41,157,116,185,205,19,10,69,251,113,93,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
