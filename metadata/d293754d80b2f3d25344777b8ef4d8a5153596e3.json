We quickly put in place a procedure to stop it,&quot; Philippe Meinrad, co-manager of Agrivalor, told Reuters.\n\nHe said the company had cleaned its containers and incoming waste would now be stored in a covered hall.\n\nMars operates a chocolate factory near Strasbourg, around 62 miles away from the affected apiaries.\n\nBee numbers have been rapidly declining around the world in the last few years and the French government has banned a widely used pesticide, Cruiser OSR, that one study has linked to high mortality rates.\n\nFrance is one of the largest producers of honey within the European Union, producing some 18,330 tonnes annually, according to a recent audit conducted for national farm agency FranceAgriMer.\n\nRibeauville, situated on a scenic wine route southwest of Strasbourg, is best known for its vineyards. But living aside winemakers are about 2,400 beekeepers in Alsace who tend some 35,000 colonies and produce about 1,000 tonnes of honey per year, according to the region's chamber of agriculture.\n\nAs for the M&amp;M's-infused honey, union head Frieh said it might taste like honey, but there the comparison stopped.\n\n&quot;For me, it's not honey. It's not sellable.&quot;\n\nSource: Reuters\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d293754d80b2f3d25344777b8ef4d8a5153596e3","amp;dn":"%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9+%D0%BC%D1%91%D0%B4+%5Bfr%5D.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d293754d80b2f3d25344777b8ef4d8a5153596e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,147,117,77,128,178,243,210,83,68,119,123,142,244,216,165,21,53,150,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
