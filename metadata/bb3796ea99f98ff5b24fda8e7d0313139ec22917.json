It comes live, meaning it runs from your CD/DVD or USB drive so you can use it on your Windows or Mac machines without installing. Clicking an icon on your desktop will step you through what is arguably the easiest Linux installer around, and you will be up and going in no time. MEPIS comes with much of the software most users need, and hundreds of additional open-source programs are just a click away--Community members keep you up-to-date. Finally, great user support is available from a complete Manual, a rich Wiki, and a very friendly Forum.\n\nThats what the website says...fairly good OS...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb3796ea99f98ff5b24fda8e7d0313139ec22917","amp;dn":"Simply+Mepis-32+bit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb3796ea99f98ff5b24fda8e7d0313139ec22917","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,55,150,234,153,249,143,245,178,79,218,142,125,3,19,19,158,194,41,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
