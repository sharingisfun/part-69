That's our commitment at Love Worth Finding.&quot; In response to many who are asking, has that purpose changed since the home-going of Dr. Rogers? No, God wants us to continue to proclaim the message of salvation. The messenger may be gone, but the message must continue. Millions still have not heard the precious name of Jesus or know His redeeming grace.\n\n\n \nSeed long and Prosper with Blessings from our Father. I have prayed to The Father, Bless all that Seed Long. (I have 4 year old active seeds out there, must be working for some folks!)\n\nEphesians 5:11\n11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove (expose) them.\n\n\n                                           \n\n      :thankyou:    :thankyou:     Thank You JESUS  \n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df083acb44e7fa3f5bbd1c87d5e832b9d5cc7abc","amp;dn":"POtHS+2+-+Bible+Study+-+Part+105+-+The+Politics+of+Pilgrims+by+A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df083acb44e7fa3f5bbd1c87d5e832b9d5cc7abc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,8,58,203,68,231,250,63,91,189,28,135,213,232,50,185,213,204,122,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
