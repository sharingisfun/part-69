It can help you transform your pictures into expressive and colorful works of art. \n\nIn addition to tools for enhancing your photos, there are paint brushes that let you make abstract painted interpretations of photos. You can select a brush and copy image features by cloning or painting. Brushes can track the direction of movement, or you can set the brush direction. You can also change the hue, saturation and blur of brush strokes as you go.\n\nApp Hints\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Use large brush strokes to fill the canvas, then use smaller brush strokes to reveal detail\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Use Brushes in &quot;Clone&quot; mode instead of &quot;Paint&quot; mode to copy the source image to the canvas\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Use Tools-&gt;Blend undo.. to vary the density of your most recent change to the canvas\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Use the Airbrush in &quot;Clone&quot; mode to blend the image directly to the canvas after painting with brush strokes\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Try clearing to White, Black or Cream using the Fill menu before painting\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Add color noise to brush strokes to make a lively variation in the color\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Use less or no color noise when painting on skin tones\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Use the HDR correction feature on images that have people in the shadows\n\nNote\nThe maximum output image size is based on the CPU and graphics capabilities of your iOS device.\n\nFeatured Functionality\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Zoom and pan your canvas to do detailed work\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Image cropping\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ 10 levels of undo and redo\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Camera support for devices with cameras\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Gallery of sample images provided\n\nWhat's in this version:\nNow you can select the image size to paint higher resolution images. There is an improved user interface with enhance and paint modes, and the app uses less memory on your device. You can also choose to start painting with a blank canvas when a new image is loaded. Image processing is made faster with OpenGL ES 2.0, and PhotoViva also now links to online documentation.\n\n\n\n                                By bobiras2009\t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e281f9db106033712e7f00a7f6cad081f602cb8","amp;dn":"PhotoViva+v2.06+Final+By+bobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e281f9db106033712e7f00a7f6cad081f602cb8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,40,31,157,177,6,3,55,18,231,240,10,127,108,173,8,31,96,44,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
