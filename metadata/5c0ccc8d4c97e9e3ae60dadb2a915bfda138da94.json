As always, you need to have a USB flash drive with 4GB or more disk space to use the drive for this operation.\n \nPlease note that the tool should be launched as administrator. To do this, right-click on Windows 8 USB Installer Maker and then click Run as administrator. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t forget to backup data from the USB drive before using to make bootable media","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c0ccc8d4c97e9e3ae60dadb2a915bfda138da94","amp;dn":"Windows+8+USB+Installer+Maker","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c0ccc8d4c97e9e3ae60dadb2a915bfda138da94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,12,204,141,76,151,233,227,174,96,218,219,42,145,91,253,161,56,218,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
