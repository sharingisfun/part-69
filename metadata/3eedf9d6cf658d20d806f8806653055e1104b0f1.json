Because the ISO file retained complete data information of the compact disc (including compact disc boot information), you were allowed the convenience to use commonly used CD/DVD burning software (for example Nero-Burning ROM ) to record the disc with your CD-R/RW or DVD-R/RW over and over forever, it can also be used directly through Virtual CD/DVD-ROM drive software (for example Daemon-Tools ) .\n\nUltraISO is an ISO CD/DVD image file creating/editing/converting tool and a bootable CD/DVD maker , it can directly edit the CD/DVD image file and extract files and folders from it, as well as directly make ISO files from your CD/DVD-ROM or hard disk.
