Mawra\nProduced by George Weiss\n\n2 AVI (Xvid) files, the feature film (60 minutes) and the trailer.\n\nA documentary by the makers of the &quot;Olga&quot; films (WHITE SLAVES OF CHINATOWN, OLGA'S GIRLS, OLGA'S HOUSE OF SHAME). Similar in style are &quot;Chained Girls&quot; and the &quot;Olga&quot; films, beautiful black and white photography, lots of narration, no dialogue and an effective classical music soundtrack.\n\nExposes the secret world of the Lesbian, how she lives and loves.\n\nHilariously awful, self-contradictory and ludicrous script, sounds like an essay written the day it's due by a 6th grader on the bus to school, delivered by narrator Holt with perfect seriousness. Phony statistics and dumb graphics give the adult-theater-going public the lowdown on lesbians.\n\nAll in all, a very enjoyable way to pass an hour.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3dacf53a7a60c4d64a16565baafef6ef15c9a042","amp;dn":"Chained+Girls+%281965%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3dacf53a7a60c4d64a16565baafef6ef15c9a042","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,172,245,58,122,96,196,214,74,22,86,91,170,254,246,239,21,201,160,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
