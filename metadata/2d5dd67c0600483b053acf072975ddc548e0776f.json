This Is Static-X[/i] is a rockumentary DVD that was set to be released in 2001 by industrial metal band Static-X. It features behind-the-scenes and live footage, along with all of Static-X's music videos (at the time) and an audio-only concert. Due to the live footage being recorded at Ozzfest, Sharon Osbourne threatened to sue the band if the DVD was released; therefore, it was prevented from ever hitting store shelves. Given this, it is very hard to find and roughly only 500 copies are in existence.\n\nHelp me sharing this by uploading as much as you can, at least a ratio of 1!\nEnjoy and seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d5dd67c0600483b053acf072975ddc548e0776f","amp;dn":"Static-X+-+Where+the+hell+are+we...+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d5dd67c0600483b053acf072975ddc548e0776f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,93,214,124,6,0,72,59,5,58,207,7,41,117,221,197,72,224,119,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
