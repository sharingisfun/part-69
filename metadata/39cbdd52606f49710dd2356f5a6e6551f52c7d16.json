He lives with his mother, father, and fellow high school student Hiromi Yuasa who moved into his house after her father died. Her father had been a close friend of the family, so it was natural for Hiromi to come stay with the Nakagami family; one year has passed since she came to live in their home. Shin'ichirÃ…ï¿½ has known Hiromi for years, but before he had always treasured her smile, though now she acts coldly when at home and he cannot bring up the nerve to talk with her either. When she is at school, Hiromi is popular, always smiles, and is talented in sports, but Shin'ichirÃ…ï¿½ knows she must be hiding things inside her. At school, he meets a strange girl named Noe Isurugi who wishes him misfortune after Shin'ichirÃ…ï¿½ teases her. After a bit of bad luck, he reconciles with Noe by crafting a chicken out of a tissue box, and he finds out from her that she &quot;gave her tears away&quot;. Shin'ichirÃ…ï¿½ also likes to spend time with his childhood friends Miyokichi Nobuse and Aiko EndÃ…ï¿½ at the Imagawayaki shop Aiko's family owns, and she helps out at the shop too.\nThe opening video of the anime contains shots of the Tateyama mountain range in Toyama Prefecture, Japan, and is where the series is set. Incidentally, the animation studio which produced the anime, P.A. Works, is located in JÃ…ï¿½hana, Toyama, and places in the series are modeled after that town. However, the town in True Tears faces the sea, and in reality JÃ…ï¿½hana is inland. The seaside was modeled after Himi, Toyama, the shopping centered from Toyama, Toyama, and Aiko's shop the fountain in the park were modeled from Takaoka, Toyama. Furthermore, three surnames used in the seriesÃ¢â‚¬â€Isurugi, Kurobe, and TakaokaÃ¢â‚¬â€are place names in Toyama Prefecture.\n\n_______\n\nThank you for downloading.
