After taking the picture, it acquires the location of your device and forms a Google maps link, sending it with the timestamped picture to your email/Facebook !\n\n*See* the face and *locate* who stole your device ! Do you want to know who's using your device, stealing it, or just opening it up and snoop around on it for less than a beer price ? Well, GotYa! is your choice!\nBy having an unlock code on your device GotYa! hooks into that, and once the password/pin/pattern is entered wrong, it allows the device to take a pic of the face of the thief, log the location, and send you an email/Facebook !\nYou can even tell GotYa! to shoot and locate every time the screen turns on ! Moreover, through simple remote SMS commands, you can even :\n- Request remotely a location\n- Request remotely a call back\n- Play remotely an alarm sound\n- Be notified on SIM change\nForget about others anti-theft application ! GotYa! is THE choice !\n\nThis is the FULL version of GotYa!, with the following *outstanding* features :\n- *FULL* size image capture\n- Email/Facebook notifications support with location\n- Remote SMS commands\n- Smart screen ON capture trigger\n- Queued system notifications support\n- Incremental, timestamped, captures support\n\nBe sure to setup the system screen lock and that's it !\nGotYa! memory needs are NULL : since GotYa! is deeply hooked into the screen lock, no permanent service is needed : it is only started on wrong login. It will NOT start long running services, excepted for sending emails but will shutdown as soon as finished.\n\n\n\n                                By bobiras2009\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fab2be71af6313407e99d94b6ddeb48f6530396","amp;dn":"GotYa%21+Face+trap+%21+Anti+Theft+By+bobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fab2be71af6313407e99d94b6ddeb48f6530396","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,171,43,231,26,246,49,52,7,233,157,148,182,221,235,72,246,83,3,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
