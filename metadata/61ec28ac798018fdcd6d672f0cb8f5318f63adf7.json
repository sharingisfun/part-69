They also moved to Chicago, leaving behind their old pastoral haunt of Urbana, IL. Despite the new addresses, they became more acquainted with life on the road, living the last two years\nin a virtual limbo. They countered this by exploring the depths of atmospheric pop rock together, working on nearly twenty new songs. On 'You're Still a Lover', recorded at Chicago's Pieholden Suite Sound, Santah creates and couches themselves in a new sonic home, the first warm wave of many to come.\n\n\nMembers :\n\tPlock\n\tMcConnell(s)\n\tStuparitz\n\tTrafton\n\n\n(info taken from band's Facebook profile)\n\n\nband's website :\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.santahmusic.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.santahmusic.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.last.fm/music/Santah&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.last.fm/music/Santah&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nIf you like their music, support the band by buying albums !!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61ec28ac798018fdcd6d672f0cb8f5318f63adf7","amp;dn":"Santah+discography+%282012%29+2+Albums","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61ec28ac798018fdcd6d672f0cb8f5318f63adf7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,236,40,172,121,128,24,253,205,109,103,47,12,184,245,49,143,99,173,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
