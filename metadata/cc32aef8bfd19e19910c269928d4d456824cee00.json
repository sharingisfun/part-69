Three valiant humans -- Flash Gordon, Dale Arden and Dr. Hans Zarkov -- are plucked from the Earth, traveling to the distant planet Mongo. Their exploits are legendary, battling the machinations and terror schemes of the dreaded emperor Ming, the All-Seeing Ruler of Mongo. But they did not fight alone...Written by Eric Trautmann (Vampirella, Red Sonja), from a story and designs by Alex Ross (Kingdom Come, Marvels, Project: Superpowers), and illustrated by Daniel Lindro.\n\nFlash Gordon: Zeitgeist #6 - The Rebels in the Walls\nAs Earth burns beneath the might of a Mongo-allied Third Reich, Ming the Merciless's domination plans are on the cusp of success.

Allegiances are forged and battle lines are drawn as Dynamite adds to the legend of the greatest space fantasy hero of all.\n\nFlash Gordon: Zeitgeist #7 - Pomp &amp; CircumStance\nAs Ming prepares for the final offensive against the Earth, Flash Gordon -- and allies both new and old -- moves against Ming's palace.
