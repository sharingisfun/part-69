thriller comes along that  gets under\n           your skin, churns  your guts and  leaves you gasping  for air.\n           Chopper did it. So did Two Hands, Lantana and Noise.\n\n           Now Australia has produced a new thriller that packs the  same\n           raw emotional punch. First time feature Director Nash Edgerton\n           and his brother- writer and star- Joel Edgerton, have  crafted\n           an  intense, brooding  and provocative  film noir  laced with\n           moral  corruption and  lit with  a slow  burning fuse...  What\n           happens when seemingly good people do bad deeds, how far  will\n           they go to protect what's  theirs, to what extremes will  they\n           resort  to bury  the truth?  Featuring a  powerhouse ensemble\n           cast, the  Edgerton Brothers  take you  to a  dark and  gritty\n           world where no-one is who they seem and everyone has a price.\n \n \n           \n                                                 \n                         CAST                          \n                                                     \n                                                             \n           \n \n\n           David Roberts               ......
