It was released November 1st, 2000 for the computer, published by Sierra Entertainment and developed by Valve Corporation. It was the creation of a new series, the Counter-Strike series. Since the creation of the series, many games have been created such as Counter-Strike: Condition Zero and Counter-Strike: Source.\nThe game started as a Half-Life mod, created on the brand-new Goldsource engine. Both the mod and the game shared nearly the same attributes: they were both fast-paced, team-oriented games. The original Counter-Strike didn't include any single-player campaigns or computer-controlled players. Although, several server-side modifications added bots. Counter-Strike was the most popular Half-Life mod for many years and still is one of the most popular PC games. Since its release, Counter-Strike has sold over 4.2 million copies, more than any other Valve game besides Half-Life and Half-Life 2.\n\nNoSteam Version,Single player(with bots) and Multiplayer (compatible with Online Servers)\n\nJust download it and have some fun =)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43b6df07d118f3dc7ab5d676ba1f1a986fc5390d","amp;dn":"Counter+Strike+1.6+FULL+By+J3r1ch0Y2k","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43b6df07d118f3dc7ab5d676ba1f1a986fc5390d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,182,223,7,209,24,243,220,122,181,214,118,186,31,26,152,111,197,57,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
