Now, this is not news.  We've known this.  We here, and thus you, have known it for a while, but it's been confirmed over and over, while Obama continues to cite this video.  It's been confirmed, Obama lied about the cause of the attacks on our embassies.  We've been chronicling this in our Morning Updates all week long.  Maybe now Obama can explain why CNN found the ambassador's diary and our government didn't.  CNN went over there after it was declared a crime scene, after Obama said nobody can answer any questions about this because the FBI's gonna go over and look at it.
