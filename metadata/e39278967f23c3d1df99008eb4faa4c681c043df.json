Before long, I was torrenting quite a few titles here on The Pirate Bay.  So it sort of became my goal to share 1000 albums with everyone before the end of that year.\n\nWas it possible?  It seemed like a long shot.  And unfortunately I only got started in September.  So by late December I came short of my goal when I hit 964 titles in my 36th bundle of that year.\n\nIt was a lot of work.  True.  But anyone who knows the parable of the seed knows that not all seeds grow.  So if my efforts could truly just impact one life, it was more than worth it.\n\nToday, in contrast to the 36 bundles and 964 titles I shared in 2011, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m sharing my 37th bundle and 965th title in 2012, just 35 titles shy of reaching that goal.  Suddenly sharing 1000 in 2012 seems quite possible with still two and a half months to go.\n\nAs always, please do the right thing and support the artists of those albums you sample that you wish to continue to listen to.  And thanks to everyone who has continue to support these torrents well after IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve moved onto the next bundle.\n\nThe 29 titles in this 37th bundle today include...\n\n * Antonio Clark And New Mercy - 2012 - Sounds Of sunday\n * Beckah Shae - 2012 - Rest - Single\n * Beckah Shae - 2012 - Your Presence - Single\n * Convictions - 2012 - I Am Nothing\n * Eleventyseven - 2012 - Attack Of The Mountain Medley EP\n * Fiction In Motion - 2012 - Hope This Ride Never Ends EP\n * Flatfoot 56 - 2012 - I Believe It EP\n * Further Seems Forever - 2012 - So Cold - Single\n * Hyland - 2012 - Beauty In The Broken - Single\n * Imani Uzuri - 2012 - The Gypsy Diaries\n * Insyderz - 2012 - Sinner's Songbook\n * Jason Castro - 2012 - Starting Line EP\n * Jesus Geek - 2012 - Good Times - Single\n * Karyn Williams - 2012 - Only You\n * Knucklehead - 2012 - Toe Tappy - Single\n * Lecrae - 2012 - Gravity - Acapellas\n * Lecrae - 2012 - Gravity - Best Buy Exclusive Remixes\n * Lecrae - 2012 - Gravity - Deluxe Edition\n * Lecrae - 2012 - Gravity - Instrumentals\n * Marcus Miller - 2012 - Renaissance\n * NailDriven - 2012 - As Long As We're Here\n * Relentless Flood - 2012 - Stand\n * RifleX - 2012 - The Entitlement EP\n * Scott Allen And Friends - 2012 - Last Adam\n * Shiwan - 2012 - Divine Treasures\n * Uncle Reece - 2012 - Until I Pass Out - Single\n * Various - 2012 - Passionate Hope, Vol 2\n * Various - 2012 - Passionate Hope, Vol 3\n * Zouk Riddim - 2012 - Come To Jesus - Single\n\nGod Bless,\nTorrentTracts - September 2012\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e39278967f23c3d1df99008eb4faa4c681c043df","amp;dn":"2012+-+The+Year+In+Christian+Music+%28Bundle+37+of+37%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e39278967f23c3d1df99008eb4faa4c681c043df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,146,120,150,127,35,195,209,223,153,0,142,180,250,164,198,129,192,67,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
