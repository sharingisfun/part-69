However, it is also one of KaulÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most experimental features (Kaul couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t ideally be classified as an experimental filmmaker) and employs a fragmented narrative structure (which keeps spreading out to new directions) with constant chronological jumps back and forth, an absurd, magic realist tone (which reveals a tenderness towards his characters and his geography) and a potpourri of filmmaking modes (including canned laughter of sitcoms and internal monologues of low-end TV dramas). Set at the fag end of the 60s, Naukar Ki Kameez, which centers on a lower-middle class clerk, Santu, in a government office, and his wife, for most part, is a simple metaphorical tale of upward class mobility and its psychological and social impediments. Santu is a bundle of contradictions; he is conscious of class divisions and the need for revolution and yet harbours hope for social-climbing, he recognizes the need to respect the other, yet casually oppresses his wife, whom he genuinely loves as well. Like AravindanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Oridathu (1986), it gives us a nation with an identity crisis: one caught between extreme Westernization and dreams of a revolution Ã¢â‚¬â€œ between tradition and modernity Ã¢â‚¬â€œ posing a question to itself: To wear or to tear?\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f528c1e67f8840cfab69a104b1c43711c515922","amp;dn":"Naukar+Ki+Kameez+%281999%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f528c1e67f8840cfab69a104b1c43711c515922","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,82,140,30,103,248,132,12,250,182,154,16,75,28,67,113,28,81,89,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
