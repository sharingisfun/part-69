Preceded by two UK Top 40 hits, &quot;New York City&quot; \n\n(#15) and &quot;Dreamy Lady&quot; (#30), Futuristic Dragon was released in January, \n\nreaching #50. It was T. Rex's first album to register in the charts since \n\nZinc Alloy and the Hidden Riders of Tomorrow in 1974. The album features \n\nsome unusually dense production from Bolan, with hints that he had been \n\nlistening to old Phil Spector records, especially &quot;Chrome Sitar&quot; and \n\n&quot;Calling All Destroyers&quot;, which contained unusual musical embellishements \n\nsuch as sitar and other sonic sound effects.\n\n\nFuturistic Dragon was remastered for CD by Edsel Records in 1994 as part of \n\ntheir extensive T. Rex reissue campaign. A number of bonus tracks were \n\nadded. A companion release, entitled Dazzling Raiment (The \n\nAlternate Futuristic Dragon), was released in 1997 which contained \n\nalternative versions, studio rough mixes and solo recordings of the main \n\nalbum and bonus tracks. A combined album digipak (MEDCD719) was released in \n\n2002.\n\n\n\nFuturistic Dragon (1976)\n------------------------\n\nMarc Bolan - vocals, guitars, moog\nGloria Jones - backing vocals, clavinet\nSteve Currie - bass\nDavy Lutton - drums\nJimmy Haskell - organ, keyboard\n\nAll tracks written by Marc Bolan, and published by Wizard (Bahamas) Ltd. \nThankx Paul Fenton - drums\nTyrone Scott - vocals\nJimmy Haskell - string arrangements\n\nCover artwork - George Underwood\nRecorded at MRI Studios, Hollywood\nEngineers - Gary Ulmer, Ray and Mike\n\nProduced by Marc Bolan\n\nLyrics encoded in comment section of files\n\n1.\t&quot;Futuristic Dragon (Introduction)&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:52\n2.\t&quot;Jupiter Liar&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:42\n3.\t&quot;Chrome Sitar&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:14\n4.\t&quot;All Alone&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:50\n5.\t&quot;New York City&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:58\n6.\t&quot;My Little Baby&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:09\n7.\t&quot;Calling All Destroyers&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:57\n8.\t&quot;Theme for a Dragon&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:00\n9.\t&quot;Sensation Boulevard&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:49\n10.\t&quot;Ride My Wheels&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:28\n11.\t&quot;Dreamy Lady&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:55\n12.\t&quot;Dawn Storm&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:43\n13.\t&quot;Casual Agent&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:00\n\nBonus Tracks\n\n14.\t&quot;London Boys&quot; - 2:22\n15.\t&quot;Laser Love&quot; - 3:38\n16.\t&quot;Life's an Elevator&quot; - 2:24\n\n\nDazzling Raiment: The Alternate Futuristic Dragon (1997)\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nAlbum compiled and annotated by Martin Barden and Ros Davies\n\nThanks to Mark Paytress and Harry Feld\n\nSingles and press clippings courtesy of the Alex Pullan archives\n\n1.\t&quot;Futuristic Dragon (Introduction)&quot; - 1:48\n2.\t&quot;Chrome Sitar&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:16\n3.\t&quot;All Alone&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:50\n4.\t&quot;New York City&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:58\n5.\t&quot;My Little Baby&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:51\n6.\t&quot;Sensation Boulevard&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:49\n7.\t&quot;Dreamy Lady&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:50\n8.\t&quot;Dawn Storm&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:31\n9.\t&quot;Casual Agent&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:55\n\nExtended Play\n\n10.\t&quot;London Boys&quot; - 2:20\n11.\t&quot;Life's an Elevator&quot; - 2:25\n12.\t&quot;Futuristic Dragon (Introduction)&quot; - 1:53\n\nBonus Outtakes\n\n13.\t&quot;All Alone&quot; - 3:51\n14.\t&quot;Dreamy Lady&quot; - 2:32\n15.\t&quot;Casual Agent&quot; - 4:06\n16.\t&quot;Casual Agent&quot; - 4:04\n\nSolo Recordings\n\n17.\t&quot;All Alone&quot; (Solo recording) - 2:47\n18.\t&quot;Dreamy Lady&quot; (Solo recording) - 2:19\n19.\t&quot;London Boys&quot; (Solo recording) - 1:56\n20.\t&quot;Life's an Elevator&quot; (Solo recording) - 1:59","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31eef3e47992ecab3f79e3e08fb72cbea7e9d63f","amp;dn":"T%2C+Rex+-+Futuristic+Dragon+%281976%29+-+2CD+2002+Extended+Edition+-+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31eef3e47992ecab3f79e3e08fb72cbea7e9d63f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,238,243,228,121,146,236,171,63,121,227,224,143,183,44,190,167,233,214,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
