And Dean Baker (Center for Economic &amp; Policy Research), examined Romney's ability to game the tax code with Chinese investment.\n\nThen, Newt Gingrich joined Todd &quot;legitimate rape&quot; Akin on the campaign trail, and said Romney will change his mind about supporting the controversial candidate.  Ed asked Howard Fineman (Huffington Post) how low the Republican party will go to win the Senate.\n\nMitt Romney is struggling with Hispanic voters, and yet he got rock star reception at the Univision forum.  It turns out he stacked the crowd with supporters, and it's not the first time (first at NAACP). Annette Taddeo (member of the Miami Dade Democratic Party),weighed in on that.\n\nMitt Romney thought it was a problem that airplane windows don't open. Ed explained to him why it's a bad idea.\n\nIn the Big Finish, Nicole Lamoureux (Director at the National Association of Free Clinics), joined Ed to discuss Romney's latest health care flip flop, and what it means for the uninsured.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:edb4c84144c05c8e34c881a835abaa619b048eb4","amp;dn":"The+Ed+Show+9-24-12.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"edb4c84144c05c8e34c881a835abaa619b048eb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,180,200,65,68,192,92,142,52,200,129,168,53,171,170,97,155,4,142,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
