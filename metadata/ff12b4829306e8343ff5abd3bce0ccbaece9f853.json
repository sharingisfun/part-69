He's horrified to discover    \n    that, not only have we lost the vast majority of our      \n    cherry orchards, but hardly any of the cherries we eat     \n    in the UK were grown here. His campaign takes him to      \n    meet growers who are trying to buck the trend and fight  \n    back, not only with new strains of sweeter, larger        \n    cherries, but with old-fashioned heritage varieties.       \n    Gary's powers of persuasion to make us fall back in       \n    love with the British cherry come to the fore in the     \n    'Revival' kitchen, where he prepares some exceptional     \n    dishes, including his signature dessert - a delectable     \n    cherry clafoutis.                                         \n                                                             \n    Award-winnnng food writer and restaurateur Yotam          \n    Ottolenghi is passionate about nuts. He uses them in       \n    many of his recipes as they are an integral ingredient    \n    in Middle Eastern cookery. He discovers that although    \n    Britain has a rich history of growing nuts, most of us    \n    are completely unaware of this tradition. We can grow      \n    fantastic walnuts in the UK but not enough for them to    \n    be commercially viable, so most walnuts we eat are       \n    imported. Yotam wants this to change and for us to get    \n    behind our native nuts like the British cobnut - a nut     \n    that most people have never heard of unless they live     \n    in Kent, where it is grown. To get us to appreciate      \n    these homegrown delicacies, he creates some fantastic     \n    sweet and savoury dishes including a magnificent cobnut    \n    crumble cream and roasted aubergines with an amazing      \n    walnut salsa.                                            \n      \n\n      \n            .  . ..: RiPPER/RELEASE NOTES :.. .  .           \n                                                              \n          &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b017l769&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b017l769&lt;/a&gt;            \n                                                              \n                                                             \n                                                              \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                             \n      \n\n                                             \n                  ..: GROUP NEWS/CONTACT :..  \n                                                           \n                                                      \n       SFM is dedicated to bringing you high quality     \n      TVRips and DVDRips of popular series and movies for   \n                     your viewing pleasure!                 \n                                                           \n       We are currently looking for:                       \n       - 100+ Mbit EU dump site for exclusive SFM usage   \n       - HDTV/PDTV cappers                                \n       - Crates &amp; Kegs of Beer (full of course)          \n                                                         \n                  .  . ..: GREETZ :.. .  .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff12b4829306e8343ff5abd3bce0ccbaece9f853","amp;dn":"Great.British.Food.Revival.S02E08.720p.HDTV.x264-SFM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff12b4829306e8343ff5abd3bce0ccbaece9f853","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,18,180,130,147,6,232,52,63,245,171,211,188,224,204,186,236,233,248,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
