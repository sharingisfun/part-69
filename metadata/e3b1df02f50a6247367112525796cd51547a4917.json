This can be played on a jumbo-tron with the viewer 9 meters away.\n\nAny feedback, positive or negative would be treated as cool.\n\nPhase one is quite free, of course. Congrats for early downloaders.\nSend me an e-mail to become a favored nation.\n\nPhase too is of course quite free, but if you are able and motivated, I'll have a donation button up at Steveblackimages.com.\n$5.00 would rule!!!\n\nPhase 3 will be subsequent editions on Amazon and here for free. Help if you can...stay tuned.\n\nPreview video direct from disk:\n\nCarina Contest\n\nLuminous Flesh Giant\n\nHappy Holidays from M81!\n\nOrion Nebula HD Tour\n\n6 Minute Pan - Lower Third of the Carina Nebula\n\nCarina Blu Ray Menu Simulation\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3b1df02f50a6247367112525796cd51547a4917","amp;dn":"Carina+Ambient+Blu+Ray","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3b1df02f50a6247367112525796cd51547a4917","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,177,223,2,245,10,98,71,54,113,18,82,87,150,205,81,84,122,73,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
