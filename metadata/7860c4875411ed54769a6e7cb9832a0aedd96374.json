It is a straight rip of the .M2TS stream full picture and audio.\n\n\n\nAs Neo somehow becomes trapped in a train station between The Matrix and the real world, Morpheus, Trinity, and Seraph set out to rescue him by means of the Merovingian. As this is going on, the Machines are approaching Zion with the intent of laying waste to every human there, but they do not realize that something is taking over The Matrix, with the intent of destroying everything: Smith. After Neo is freed, he and Trinity take the Logos and make a beeline for the Machine City. The Machines have reached Zion and the battle of a lifetime rages on. However, there is one way to save Zion and put an end to the war, and that is Neo. He must venture into the Matrix and put an end to Smith's evil plans once and for all, and if he succeeds, Zion will live to see another day. It's like the Oracle says, &quot;Everything that has a beginning has an end\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7860c4875411ed54769a6e7cb9832a0aedd96374","amp;dn":"The+Matrix+Revolutions+1080p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7860c4875411ed54769a6e7cb9832a0aedd96374","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,96,196,135,84,17,237,84,118,154,110,124,185,131,42,10,237,217,99,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
