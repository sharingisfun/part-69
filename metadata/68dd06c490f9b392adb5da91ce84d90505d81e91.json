Hadley (AgentParsec). It shares the same gameplay elements as the original - you must collect 8 pages while avoiding the enemy. This is not intended to be a copy - simply a way for people who loved Slender to be able to face their fear on a different map with the same awesome gameplay. There are some differences which will make playing a somewhat unique experience - different AI, new sounds, and a different environment.\n\nv1.0 of Claustrophobia has been released.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68dd06c490f9b392adb5da91ce84d90505d81e91","amp;dn":"Slender+-+Claustrophobia+v1.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68dd06c490f9b392adb5da91ce84d90505d81e91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,221,6,196,144,249,179,146,173,181,218,145,206,132,217,5,5,216,30,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
