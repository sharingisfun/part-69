When the legendary underground superstar TK Kirkland takes the stage it's more than stand-up comedy, it's a seminar, and the subject is real talk on relationships, lovemaking, self-esteem and just plain common sense. The inimitable Hip-Hop comedy bad boy has performed for sold-out crowds opening for stars including Jay-Z, 50 Cent, Kid Rock, Keyshia Cole, Lil Wayne and Nelly. Check out TK's raw style on his first-ever DVD - and if you're easily offended, please back away now. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS? No? Good.\n\nStudio: Image Entertainment\nDVD Release Date: December 16, 2008\nRun Time: 72 minutes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7dc5a768ebead4cfc98d076bb44c4964ec45d8d0","amp;dn":"TK_KIRKLAND_ARE_THERE_ANY_QUESTIONS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7dc5a768ebead4cfc98d076bb44c4964ec45d8d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,197,167,104,235,234,212,207,201,141,7,107,180,76,73,100,236,69,216,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
