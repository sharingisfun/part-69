Live Happy is based on Dr. LyubomirskyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s happiness research and key elements from her book.\n\nGoing about life in a way that makes one happier is a skill that can be acquired and mastered when one consciously chooses to commit and work at it on a daily basis. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s similar to the way a physical exercise program involves small individual tasks like lifting weights or running that add up to a healthier and more efficient body. By creating an application for the iPhone and iPod, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve made it easy for anyone to follow this research-based program wherever they are, and follow the simple daily activities that can result in a new mindset.\n\nMORE INFORMATION\nVisit us at www.LiveHappyApp.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0678efcb08a34f2a046719e7460ae0939084c76","amp;dn":"Live+Happy+-+A+Happiness+Boosting+Positive+Psychology+Program","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0678efcb08a34f2a046719e7460ae0939084c76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,103,142,252,176,138,52,242,160,70,113,158,116,96,174,9,57,8,76,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
