Also with the License comes Ultimate SMS Screen, the name says it all.\n\nAll this on the same package, working from Android V2.1 to ICS, on any resolution on any phone.\n\nThere is no limit on the number of contacts you can personalize or block on the Free version. There are no adds and no timeouts. I believe on added functionality for value, not crippling the app to force buys.\n\nImportant:\nTo access the dialpad and other standard functions, press &quot;back&quot; button while on a call, or use the enable the &quot;swipe down&quot; feature to do the same\n\nFeature:\n\nGeneral:\n\n    No limit on number of contacts to personalize.\n    Apply pictures to contacts directly from your gallery, with the android &quot;share&quot; function. Just choose &quot;Add to UCS&quot;!\n\nFull Screen Caller ID\n\n    Selectively enable only for outgoing/incoming calls\n    Enable swipe gestures to bring up the default phone interface\n    Press &quot;Back&quot; when UCS is handling a call to jump back to your default phone interface\n\nWhat's in this version : (Updated : Sep 10, 2012)\n\n    Fixed error on lower resolution devices when auto-syncing to internal android database\n    Fixed error when defining default pictures for known/unknown callers on certain cases\n    Performance improvements\n    Minor bugfixes\n\nRequired Android O/S : 2.1+\n\n\n                                By bobiras2009\t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07642d9a229a48b18085259864cdccc1d93efe3a","amp;dn":"Ultimate+Call+Screen+HD+Pro+v7.0.3+Final+By+bobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07642d9a229a48b18085259864cdccc1d93efe3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,100,45,154,34,154,72,177,128,133,37,152,100,205,204,193,217,62,254,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
