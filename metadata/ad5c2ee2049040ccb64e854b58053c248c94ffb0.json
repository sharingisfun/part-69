I think this guy is disastrously misguided to the point of being bent. Am I accurate to paraphrase his comment (near the 35 min mark) this way?\n\n&gt;If you can't beat 'em, kill 'em!&lt;\n\nWith regard to the surge in Chinese productivity following introduction of private property recognition, and other government reforms, he clearly states that he doesn't want to live &quot;like a Chinese, like the Chinese, I don't like them, that's why I say war. I love America and I want America to succeed.&quot;\n\nStatements like that left this American gobsmacked. I rebuke you, Mr. Leeb.\n\nAs China becomes more like America _was_ (and ought to be), Mr. Leeb's answer seems to be to make America more like China _was_, or worse: to use our military to usurp a voluntary market. It's a notion that gives me fits.\n\nReactions?\n\n[/soapbox]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad5c2ee2049040ccb64e854b58053c248c94ffb0","amp;dn":"20111103-Stossel-%5BBig+Govt-Rejected%5D-Fox+Business.CF.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad5c2ee2049040ccb64e854b58053c248c94ffb0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,92,46,226,4,144,64,204,182,78,133,75,88,5,60,36,140,148,255,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
