It features stories by Continuum creator Simon Barry and star Rachel Nichols. It is showcased on the game website of the Continuum series, currently available exclusively in Canada. \n\nSet in 2065, the eight stories shed light on Kiera's experience as a soldier in the Global Corporate Congress (GCC) army and the struggles she went through. The war she's a part of started as isolated public gatherings by the disenfranchised lower class but quickly spread across the nation. Protests turned violent as many like-minded groups, spanning all classes, joined the cause.\n\nThey were fighting for freedom from a corporate oppression that turned citizens into financial tools and undermined basic individual rights. As unrest spread through society, the GCC struggled to control the uprising, no longer able to recognize the face of their enemy.\n\nFed up with authoritarian rule by for profit corporations, the rebels organized, branding themselves Liber8. They began launching strategic violent assaults against anything and anyone that stood in their way. Liber8's goal was to burn down the establishment and make way for a new style of anarchistic rule, the likes of which had never been seen before in the western world. \n\n~~~~~~\n\nConcept: Simon Barry\nCover art: Johnnie Christmas\nColor: Dean Trippe\n\nIssue 1.
