A more humanist documentary than it might seem in summary.\n\nKroger Babb actually sent out these two films as a &quot;roadshow&quot; double feature and I hope they turned a nice profit.  Educational and fun, these films are warmly recommended as an alternative to cable TV.\n\nIMDB for Halfway to Hell: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0275394/combined&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0275394/combined&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc5e88dfce2f3a3192115f45ed93af5484b4ca94","amp;dn":"Kroger+Babb+Roadshow+Double+Feature+%281954%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc5e88dfce2f3a3192115f45ed93af5484b4ca94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,94,136,223,206,47,58,49,146,17,95,69,237,147,175,84,132,180,202,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
