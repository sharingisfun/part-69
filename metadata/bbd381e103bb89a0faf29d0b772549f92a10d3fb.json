There is truth here for all ages and beliefs\n\n\nDescription:\nThe Mysterious Islands makes a strong case for Creation and points out the flaws in Darwin\\'s evolutionary theory. This educational adventure also showcases many of the amazing animals who reside on the Galapagos Islands. Get a glimpse of the adventure by watching the trailer and scenes below. And to experience the full adventure, pick up The Mysterious Islands at your favorite Christian store!\n\nReview\nWhile there are several secular and Christian films about Charles Darwin and the Galapagos Islands being released this year, this one really does an excellent job of showing not only the beauty and uniqueness of the remote Galapagos Islands what many have called both the birthplace of Darwinism and \\'\\'Darwin s Eden,\\'\\' but also presents great teaching in regard to the creation/evolution/Genesis issues. --Ken Ham, Founder and President of Answers in Genesis\n\nReview\nAs I viewed this video I was amazed at the beauty of the Galapagos. . . . This production contains spectacular cinematography. It is both awe inspiring and educational. But most importantly, the viewer will truly understand the flaws in Darwin\\'s ideas, while at the same time realizing the truth of the Genesis account. . . . The incredible majesty of the Creator God is obvious! --Dr. Tommy Mitchell\n\n\n Confirmed Sighting - Jesus Lives - coming 7-4-11.\n\n\nThis is dedicated to my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.\n\n\nThe Entire Collection can be found here: \n\n[color=red]JESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe That The Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn\\'t PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed..\n\n\\&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n\\&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...\n\nMay Yahweh Bless You as He has me. Seed Long and Prosper from the Blessings of our Lord. I have asked the Father to Bless all those that Seed Long.  \n\nDo Not believe anything you find here, search the Scriptures daily to determine the tRUtH.    \n\n\nGet info on the Take Over by The New World Order Below\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.khouse.org/topical_bible_study&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.khouse.org/topical_bible_study&lt;/a&gt;                                                         Free online Bible Study &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.babylonthegreatisfalling.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.babylonthegreatisfalling.net&lt;/a&gt;                                                                End Times Prophecy - Who is Babylon the Great &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.hickoryhammockbaptist.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.hickoryhammockbaptist.org&lt;/a&gt;                                                                Pastueur Carl Gallops\n                                                                                       Listen to Alex Jones   Secular Truth &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.overcomers.ca&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.overcomers.ca&lt;/a&gt;                                                                                     Current Bible Prophecy &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theberean.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theberean.org/&lt;/a&gt;                                                                                    Daily Bible Study in Your Email &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.khouseafrica.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.khouseafrica.com/&lt;/a&gt;                                                                               Chuck Missler - Africa &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.store.khouse.org/store/catalog&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.store.khouse.org/store/catalog&lt;/a&gt;                                                          Chuck Missler - USA\n                                       Dehydrated Survival Food -  Excellent Taste &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://store.khouse.org/store/catalog/help/pacific_rim.html?it=C3sphAod&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://store.khouse.org/store/catalog/help/pacific_rim.html?it=C3sphAod&lt;/a&gt;       Chuck Missler - New Zealand, Australia, Pacific Rim\n \nSeed long and Prosper with Blessings from our Father.
