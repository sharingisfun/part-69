The screenplay, written by Hampton Fancher and David Peoples, is loosely based on the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Philip K. Dick.\n \nThe film depicts a dystopian Los Angeles in November 2019 in which genetically engineered organic robots called replicantsÃ¢â‚¬â€visually indistinguishable from adult humansÃ¢â‚¬â€are manufactured by the powerful Tyrell Corporation as well as by other &quot;megaÃ¢â‚¬â€œmanufacturers&quot; around the world. Their use on Earth is banned and replicants are exclusively used for dangerous, menial or leisure work on off-world colonies. Replicants who defy the ban and return to Earth are hunted down and &quot;retired&quot; by police special operatives known as &quot;Blade Runners&quot;. The plot focuses on a brutal and cunning group of recently escaped replicants hiding in Los Angeles and the burnt out expert Blade Runner, Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), who reluctantly agrees to take on one more assignment to hunt them down.\n\n\nenjoy this awesome movie","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8dabff9b734b488bac5c8054e0e3921a22764320","amp;dn":"Blade+Runner+-+Clean+Version+%283%29+1982+-+divx+allan0201","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8dabff9b734b488bac5c8054e0e3921a22764320","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,171,255,155,115,75,72,139,172,92,128,84,224,227,146,26,34,118,67,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
