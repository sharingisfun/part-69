The Stonewall riots, as they came to be known, marked a major turning point in the modern gay civil rights movement in the United States and around the world.\n\nAfter the Stonewall riots, gays and lesbians in New York City faced gender, class, and generational obstacles to becoming a cohesive community. Within six months, two gay activist organizations were formed in New York, concentrating on confrontational tactics, and three newspapers were established to promote rights for gays and lesbians. Within a few years, gay rights organizations were founded across the U.S. and the world. On June 28, 1970, the first Gay Pride marches took place in Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York commemorating the anniversary of the riots. Similar marches were organized in other cities. Today, Gay Pride events are held annually throughout the world toward the end of June to mark the Stonewall riots.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonewall_riots&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonewall_riots&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSo, drymouse, how is *THIS* a &quot;neo-con&quot; upload? \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8190c151c017c3a60eec1b9707b0c1559a06e354","amp;dn":"American+Experience+-+The+Stonewall+Uprising+%5B.x264%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8190c151c017c3a60eec1b9707b0c1559a06e354","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,144,193,81,192,23,195,166,14,236,27,151,7,176,193,85,154,6,227,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
