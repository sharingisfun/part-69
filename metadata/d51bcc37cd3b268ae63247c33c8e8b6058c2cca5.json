But political prisoners existed before the Emergency, and they continue to exist even after it is over.\n\nThrough first hand accounts, the director presents details of the appalling brutality of prison procedures and the classism that permeates them. PatwardhanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s major lament is not against IndiraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s policies per se, but the very act of holding political prisoners without trial (That the film clearly points out that the situation did not improve much even after Janata Dal came to power testifies to its Ã¢â‚¬Å“nonpartisanÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ quality). What was unique about the widespread resistance to this political ploy of Indira Gandhi was that it was highly democratic in nature, with participation by both the secular Left and the Hindu-based RSS (a marriage quite unimaginable now), both workers and students, both citizens and immigrants and both radical Maoists and nonviolent Gandhians. Using the various interviews of people from each of these groups, Patwardhan attempts to examine and evaluate his own political leaning by trying to uncover socialist strains in Gandhian philosophy and the possibility of having a nonviolent base for Marxist thought\n\nAwards\nGrand Prize, The Tyne Award, UK, 1982\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073576/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073576/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMedia Info :\nLanguage - English\nVideo Size -  555 MB\nVideo Codec - Xvid\nVideo Container - AVI\nVideo Res - 640 x 480\nVideo Frame Rate - 29.970 fps @ 1892 Kbps\nAudio Codec - MP3\nSample Rate - 44100 Hz @ 128 kbps\nLength - 41 mins\n\nPosters: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/X8p2u.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/X8p2u.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nScreens : &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/FJZNL.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/FJZNL.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Ek4PK.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Ek4PK.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ugrif.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ugrif.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/VJ3dT.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/VJ3dT.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/NLtnj.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/NLtnj.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ztqGg.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ztqGg.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/cPjJv.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/cPjJv.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/0p6FF.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/0p6FF.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTakes me 5 Hours to Encode &amp; 2 Hours to Upload &amp; Months to Seed\n\nTakes me 30 Minutes to Create Description/Screen Shots etc...\n\nTakes you just 10 Seconds to say &quot;Thank You&quot;.
