The entire original creative team has been reunited as Barrymore \n returns to Toronto's historic Elgin Theatre for only 30 performances in January and February\n of 2011. Backstage with Barrymore is a documentary film about the re-creation of an incredible\n piece of theatre history. We will be there as Luce, Saks and Plummer prepare Barrymore for the\n stage again. With complete access to the entire process and interviews with each and every\n one of the people responsible for this epic adventure in theatre, Backstage with Barrymore \n will provide intimate and personal interaction with all those who contribute to both the stage\n production and the film version of Barrymore: The Legacy Performance.\n\n enjoy\n\n\n\n                            \n                                                          \n                                                   \n                                                  \n                                                  \n                                         \n                                                   \n                          \n                                       \n                                                   \n                                     \n                             \n                         \n                  \n               RESPECT TO        \n        \n       \n       \n         Abby      \n   \n        \n                  2x    \n                        SunZero 2oo6","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f6b69bd3557736fd754dcfe46969305002ae7db","amp;dn":"Backstage.With.Barrymore.2011.720p.HDTV.x264-2HD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f6b69bd3557736fd754dcfe46969305002ae7db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,107,105,189,53,87,115,111,215,84,220,254,70,150,147,5,0,42,231,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
