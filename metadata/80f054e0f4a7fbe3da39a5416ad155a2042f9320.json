In the early sixties, discoveries were made in Central Mexico, which were the handiwork of early man. Exquisitely carved animal bones and advanced spear points caused much excitement, including a Life Magazine article, until the dates came in. 5 mutually exclusive geological tests revealed they were over 250,000 years old. In spite of the geochronology, archaeologists insisted the dates were too ridiculously old. This world-class archaeological region became off-limits for official research, a &quot;professional forbidden zone.&quot;\n\nThis is the story of the shocking events that occurred, told first-hand by many of the actual participants. It reveals how one field of science can conflict with another and how new discoveries must battle evidence vs. belief, exposing what some have called &quot;the dark side of archaeology.&quot;\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChristianity Today Denies Adam - Dr Purdom Responds on Real Science Friday:\n\nSeed long and Prosper with Blessings from our Father.
