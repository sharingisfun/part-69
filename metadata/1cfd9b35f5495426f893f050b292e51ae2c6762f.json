And, as it turns out, the film also witnesses one \n   of the most significant discoveries about climate change in recent     \n   Antarctic science. Intense public focus on climate change has turned   \n   the shores of Antarctica into a new tourist mecca, making the earth's  \n   coldest continent the hot place to be. But, inland from the penguins   \n   and ice floes is a magical Antarctica of volcanoes, boulder-strewn     \n   valleys and ominous glaciers. Only a small number of scientific        \n   research teams get there...                                            \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n                                                                    \n                                                                \n                                                           \n                                                                       \n                                                            \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n                                                                       \n                                                          \n                                                           \n                                                           \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n         aAF   AMIABLE   ANiHLS  BOV   FiCO   iMBT   INSECTS  KiDDoS      \n                                                                          \n             The rest of the groups and friends keeping it real           \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n                                                                       \n                                                      \n                                                          \n                                                           \n                                                                          \n    PRiVATE AFFiLS 100MBit+ (LARGE ARCHIVES ARE A PLUS)                   \n                                                                          \n    PRE-RETAIL OR RETAIL DVDS!                                            \n                                                                          \n    SHELL AND DUMP PROVIDERS                                              \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n                                                                       \n    \n                                                                 \n                                                                     \n                                                                       \n                                                                         \n                                                                        \n                                                        ph^z!SiLK","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1cfd9b35f5495426f893f050b292e51ae2c6762f","amp;dn":"Ice.People.2008.DVDRip.XViD-DOCUMENT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1cfd9b35f5495426f893f050b292e51ae2c6762f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,253,155,53,245,73,84,38,248,147,240,80,178,146,229,26,226,198,118,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
