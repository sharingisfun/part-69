As Hisako awakens, it is revealed that Emma was hired to be her tutor, \nsince the Xavier Institute had ceased activity, and was captured when she went to Japan to search for Hisako. After defeating a group of cyborgs, the X-Men arrive at an operating room, where they are confronted by U-Men member Kick (who uses the data collected on the X-Men to gain an advantage). As he targets Emma, Hisako's mutant powers awaken, using her mind's energy to create a powerful armor which defeats Kick. However, her powers soon go out of control, but Emma manages to calm her down. As the other U-Men escape, the X-Men manage to free the other children. After making contact with Professor X, Kick returns and launches an attack at Hisako, forcing Emma to rush to protect her. \n\nSpoken Language:- English\n\n=============================\n\nScreenshots\n-----------\n\n[URL=http://img510.imageshack.us/i/xmen103armorojavithumbs.jpg/][IMG]http://img510.imageshack.us/img510/6342/xmen103armorojavithumbs.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n================================\n\nFile Info\n----------\n\n              ===== File Info ===== \nFileSize           : 176M\nPlayTime           : 00:20:59.492\nVideoCount         : 1\nAudioCount         : 1\n              ===== Video Info ===== \nVideo 0# Stream\nVideoCodec         : XVID\nVideoWidth         : 720 piexs\nVideoHeight        : 420 piexs\nVideoFrameRate     : 29.970fps\nVideoFrameCount    : 37747\nVideoBitRate       : 1033871\n              ===== Audio Info ===== \nAudio 0# Stream\nAudioCodec         : MP3\nAudioBitRate       : 128000\nAudioChannels      : 2\nAudioSampleRate    : 44100\n\n\nFormat:- AVI\n\n=============================\n\nHash\n-----\n729EFEF40E57F08DD92143A2D318580043DA6DFB\n[/center]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16454b0d8f4489d85baf4f20ba6111bae6cc2fb9","amp;dn":"X-Men+-+103+-+Armor+%5BOj%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16454b0d8f4489d85baf4f20ba6111bae6cc2fb9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,69,75,13,143,68,137,216,91,175,79,32,186,97,17,186,230,204,47,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
