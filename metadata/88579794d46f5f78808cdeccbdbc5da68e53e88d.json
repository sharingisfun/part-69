When Windows asks if you want to format it, cancel and run Image Writer again.\n\nIf the problem persists, disable your anti-virus software, it may be blocking raw write to the drive.\n\nAnother Image Writer for Windows, if SUSE doesn't work  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://launchpad.net/win32-image-writer/+download&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://launchpad.net/win32-image-writer/+download&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n- Boot the USB drive and install.\n\nDefault boot loader is Clover  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.projectosx.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=2304&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.projectosx.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=2304&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you want to use Chameleon press 1 at boot0 screen\n\nIf you need, use TransMac to delete kexts which are causing problems (System/Library/Extensions) and delete kernelcache (System/Library/Caches/com.apple.kext.caches/Startup)  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.asy.com/scrtm.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.asy.com/scrtm.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf boot stops right before reaching the installer, or graphics aren't working right, delete video kexts:\nATI = ATI*\nIntel = AppleIntelHD* and AppleIntelSNB*\nnVidia = GeForce* and NVDA*\n\nYou need at least one free partition, use Disk Utility (in the Utilities menu) to erase it as Mac Os Extended (Journaled).\n\nIf you want to install the boot loader in this partition and you use MBR (not GUID, like if you already have Windows in the HD), it must be a primary (not extended/logical) partition.\n\nWait for the installation to finish and restart.\n\n\n- Boot the USB drive, then choose to boot the HD you just installed OS X (not the installer USB again).\n\n\n- Install boot loader to the HD.\n\n\n- Install essential and other kexts you may need (network, audio, etc).\n\nFakeSMC.kext is always needed\n\nWhile you don't have power management fixed, you will probably need NullCPUPowerManagement.kext\n\nIf you use PS/2 keyboard or a laptop you will need VoodooPS2Controller.kext (or ApplePS2Controller.kext) and AppleACPIPS2Nub.kext\n\nHow to find kexts for your hardware  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://olarila.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&amp;t=1694&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://olarila.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&amp;t=1694&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n- When you format the USB drive as FAT/NTFS you'll notice its size was reduced. Just open Disk Management (Administrative Tools), remove the 5,25 GB partition and create a new one using all the drive.\n\n\nThanks to iHackintosh_PT for tutorial on creating Lion DVD  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://olarila.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=740&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://olarila.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=740&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88579794d46f5f78808cdeccbdbc5da68e53e88d","amp;dn":"OS+X+10.8.2+Mountain+Lion+bootable+USB+for+Intel+PCs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88579794d46f5f78808cdeccbdbc5da68e53e88d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,87,151,148,212,111,95,120,128,140,222,204,189,188,93,166,142,83,232,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
