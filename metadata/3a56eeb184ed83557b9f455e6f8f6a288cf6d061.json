This\ntime the source is from the scene. We used CCE also on this release\n@ 7 passes (6 passes = 7 passes in CCE for those who are wondering).\nIn any case, we hope that you are happy with our hard work. We took\nthe time to make an suitable menu in DVD Architect Pro 5.0. The\nsubtitle was made by BkX and the custom dvd-cover was made by BARFLY.\nBig thanks to you two!\n\n(The dvd-cover was NOT made specifically for this release).\n\n\nPLOT: Typical teenager Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) embraces his\nincredible destiny after uncovering one of his father's most\ncarefully guarded secrets as Columbia Pictures reboots the Spider-Man\nfranchise with the help of director Mark Webb ((500) Days of Summer)\nand screenwriter James Vanderbilt (Zodiac). Sally Field, Rhys Ifans,\nDenis Leary, Martin Sheen, and Emma Stone co-star.\n\n\nAMIABLE - BkX - BARFLY - SweSUB.nu - Swecoverdb.se\n\n\n- We are currently looking for:\n\n* 100Mbit+ EU Sites For Private Use\n* Suppliers Of Unreleased DVD's  US/EU\nWith 5 Mbit/s Upstream Minimum\n\nTEAM-FiRMAN (at) HUSH .
