Not only do the four singers turn in superb individual performances on this bi-lingual CD, but their ensemble work is often of a sublime quality. They play most of the instruments and wrote and arranged the material too.\n\nWith the hypnotic rhythmic thrust and stunning harmonies on Ã¢â‚¬ËœWedding DressÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ they set out their stall early, and little that follows on this 11 track offering falls below that dizzying standard. Ã¢â‚¬ËœDomhnach na FolaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ has a widescreen wistfulness that evokes bygone times, and thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a beguiling lightness to the pulsating Ã¢â‚¬ËœBÃƒÂ­odh Orm AnochtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Ã¢â‚¬ËœMotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s SongÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ has a Clannad-style plaintiveness, while the bubbling Ã¢â‚¬ËœCuach Mo Londubh BuÃƒÂ­Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ takes on a West African hue via MoyaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deft djembe. Richard ThompsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more traditional ballad Ã¢â‚¬ËœFarewell FarewellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is adorned by Triona NÃƒÂ­ DhomhnaillÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s subtle accordion and some more dazzling harmonies.\n\nThe Maggies are an invigorating and more than welcome addition to the scene. Extraordinary talent with a capital T.\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n01. Wedding Dress\n02. Domhnach na Fola\n03. Thugamar FhÃƒÂ©in an Samhradh Linn\n04. BÃƒÂ­odh Orm Anocht\n05. Mother Song\n06.
