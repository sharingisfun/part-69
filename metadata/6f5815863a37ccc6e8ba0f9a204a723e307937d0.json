Some of the greatest entertainment phenomenons of our time, be it The Sopranos, Lost or Hi Honey, I'm Home! have failed to give fans the closure that they, as uninvolved spectators watching at home for free, feel they are entitled to.  The Lord of The Rings series, on the other hand has mastered the art of delivering a satisfying conclusion. And The Return of The King does it so well, in fact, that it decides to end seven or eight times.\n\nThe final chapter of one of the most beloved trilogies of all time finds our characters picking up where they left off.

Gimli and Legolas have started an organic dog biscuit bakery in Vermont.  And Mushmouth is futilely trying to convince the gang to make him the Buck Buck breaker instead of Fat Albert.\n\nAll the while, the fearsome Eye of Sauron is observing their movements in a style that can best be described as &quot;pretty funny when you really think about it.&quot; There's also drunken table dancing, Elven poetry and a spider proboscis that you would best be served to never think about if you're ever considering venturing into the outdoors again.\n\nThe journey through Cirith Ungol is never an easy one, so it's best to join up with Mike, Kevin and Bill, who have their very own Light of Earendil*, tin of pipeweed**, and satchel of Lembas Bread*** \n\n*Can of Raid\n\n**Big League Chew\n\n***Bag of combos with three different flavors of Combos combined in it\n\n*******************************************************************************\nAs always donate or purchase the MP3's from Rifftrax to keep these coming...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f5815863a37ccc6e8ba0f9a204a723e307937d0","amp;dn":"Lord.of.the.Rings.Return.of.the.King.x264.Dual.Audio.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f5815863a37ccc6e8ba0f9a204a723e307937d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,88,21,134,58,55,204,198,232,186,15,154,32,74,114,62,48,121,55,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
