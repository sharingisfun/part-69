Unable to find a suitable studio and delicate sound, they we're forced to make changes. In 2009 the trio were joined by three other people: Karolina (keyboards), Greta (viola) and Modestas (guitar). In the summer of 2009 the band changed their studio location and started rehersing more than ever. This led to great progress in the band's musical style and sound. Although, in 2010 there was a change in the line-up. The band's founding member and bass player Ainis was replaced by Marius due to conflicts with other members. But this didn't stop anyone from music creation.\nIn March 2012 Life's Edge released their first debut EP 'Left in Despair\n\nMembers: \nViktor Filimonenko- Vocals, \nModestas JuÃ…Â¡kÃ„â€”nas- Guitar, \nMindaugas BitÃ„â€”- Guitar, \nMarius PetniÃ…Â«nas- Bass, \nKarolina VikÃ…Â¡raitytÃ„â€”- Keyboards, \nAugustinas BÃ„â€”kÃ…Â¡ta - Drums\n\nFacebook:\nMySpace:\nBandCamp: http://http://lifesedge.bandcamp.com/\nYouTube:\nreverbnation:","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be0063d8d49ef186f86bcef742653a2999d30e6c","amp;dn":"Life%27s+Edge+-+Left+in+Despair+-+2012+%28320+kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be0063d8d49ef186f86bcef742653a2999d30e6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,0,99,216,212,158,241,134,248,107,206,247,66,101,58,41,153,211,14,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
