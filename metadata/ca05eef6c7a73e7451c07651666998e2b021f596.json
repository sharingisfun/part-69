Girl Talk se dedica a hacer mashups o Bastard Pop, es decir, &quot;recorta&quot; y edita pequeÃƒÂ±os muestreos de canciones para lograr nuevas obras, distintas de las originales.\n\nGaylor, narrador en primera persona del documental, introduce temÃƒÂ¡ticas polÃƒÂ©micas en torno a este tipo de manifestaciones artÃƒÂ­sticas y detalla un manifiesto.\n\nEl crÃƒÂ­tico David Berry dijo en Vue Weekly que la pelÃƒÂ­cula funciona &quot;no sÃƒÂ³lo como una sÃƒÂ³lida introducciÃƒÂ³n a los derechos de autor, sino tambiÃƒÂ©n como un ensayo reflexivo acerca de por quÃƒÂ© nos deberÃƒÂ­an importar, y por quÃƒÂ© deberÃƒÂ­amos tratar de cambiarlos&quot;.\nScott Thill dijo en Wired que el director del documental &quot;lanzÃƒÂ³ el filme bajo una licencia Creative Commons y hasta adoptÃƒÂ³ el modelo de Radiohead de usted-ponga-el-precio cuando subiÃƒÂ³ la pelÃƒÂ­cula a internet&quot;.\n\n\nCreated over a period of six years, the documentary film features the collaborative remix work of hundreds of people who have contributed to the Open Source Cinema website, helping to create the &quot;world's first open source documentary&quot; as Gaylor put it. The project's working title was Basement Tapes (referring to the album of the same name) but it was renamed RiP!: A Remix Manifesto prior to theatrical release. Gaylor encourages more people to create their own remixes from this movie, using media available from the Open Source Cinema website, or other websites like YouTube, Flickr, Hulu, or MySpace.\n\nThe documentary is particularly interested in the legal grey area of remixing existing works. The film features appearances by:\n\nGregg Gillis (better known as Girl Talk) an American musician specializing in mashup-style remixes, which often use a dozen or more unauthorized samples from different songs to create an entirely new track.\n\nLawrence Lessig, an American academic and political activist, and a professor of law at Stanford Law School and founder of its Center for Internet and Society. He is best known as a proponent of reduced legal restrictions on copyright, trademark, and radio frequency spectrum, particularly in technology applications.\n\nCory Doctorow, a Canadian blogger, journalist and science fiction author. Doctorow is co-editor of the blog Boing Boing and is an activist in favor of reforming copyright laws. He is a proponent of the Creative Commons organization, using some of their licenses for his books. Common themes in his work include digital rights management and file sharing.\n\nGilberto Gil, the Brazilian musician and former Minister of Cultural Affairs who initiated pioneering programs in Brazil through a partnership with Creative Commons. As Minister, he sponsored a program called Culture Points, which gives grants to provide music technology and education to people living in poor areas of the country's cities.\n\nDan O'Neill, an underground cartoonist and founder of the Air Pirates, a group which was famously sued by The Walt Disney Company for copyright infringement.\nJammie Thomas, the single mom successfully sued by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) at the Capitol v. Thomas case for Thomas' illegal downloading. The single mother, who made US$36,000 a year, was ordered to pay US$222,220 in damages for making 24 songs available for download on the Kazaa file-sharing network.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca05eef6c7a73e7451c07651666998e2b021f596","amp;dn":"RIP%2C+A+Remix+Manifesto+%28Subtitulado%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca05eef6c7a73e7451c07651666998e2b021f596","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,5,238,246,199,167,62,116,81,192,118,81,102,105,152,226,176,33,245,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
