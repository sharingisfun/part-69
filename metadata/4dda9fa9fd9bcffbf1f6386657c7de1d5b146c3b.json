I will also upload the expansion. It does work I tested it myself. So let me know what you guys think. Enjoy the game.\n\nHow to install:\n\n1.  The image is MIR-EAW.iso now that you have the image mounted with Daemon tools or whatever ISO mounting program you use. It should autorun and you can install. If it doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t auto run go to my computer and manually start it.\n\n2.  Now go through the installation and use the cd key fc4c-3d8-05f-d411-uk20. If it doesn't work, use google for another one.\n\n3.  Copy the Crack into the GameData Folder in your C: Drive. (Easiest way to get there is  right-click on the desktop shortcut and then properties then open file location.)\n\n4.  Copy the SW:EAW Application to the desktop and delete the old shortcut, use the new one to  open the game.\n\n5. Play the game. Give me feedback on if it works or not. Thanks for downloading. Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4dda9fa9fd9bcffbf1f6386657c7de1d5b146c3b","amp;dn":"Star+Wars+Empire+at+War+with+Crack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4dda9fa9fd9bcffbf1f6386657c7de1d5b146c3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,218,159,169,253,155,207,251,241,246,56,102,87,199,222,29,91,20,108,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
