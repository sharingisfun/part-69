But they're the same generals we know in name only: their appearance, personality, and gender are all different. One day, first Oda Nobunaga and then all the others are transported to our world. Everything is new to them - bicycles, cell phones, automatic doors. Each episode focuses on one general and how she learns to adapt to the modern world.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e657fe8a6da72b53298728dc4d74a6f86780fae","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+Sengoku+Collection+-+25+%5B720p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e657fe8a6da72b53298728dc4d74a6f86780fae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,101,127,232,166,218,114,181,50,152,114,141,196,215,74,111,134,120,15,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
