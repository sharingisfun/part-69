Ã¢â‚¬Å“He gave us a phone.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe video is drawing attention to the government program Ã¢â‚¬â€ Lifeline Ã¢â‚¬â€ as a national debate unfolds on entitlements and the growing percentage of Americans who pay no income taxes and get a long menu of government benefits. But even though some beneficiaries may credit President Obama for providing the phones, Lifeline is an extension of a program that has existed since 1985. Still, critics including Rep. Tim Griffin, R-Ark., note the program has swelled from $772 million in 2008 to $1.6 billion.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“It's a government-run, taxpayer-funded program that's running wild and costing more and more,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ reads GriffinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s official House of Representatives website.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22b2a083b0de0150d62337608885506a1e8d5d43","amp;dn":"free+%27Obama+phone%27+puts+spotlight+on+federal+program","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22b2a083b0de0150d62337608885506a1e8d5d43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,178,160,131,176,222,1,80,214,35,55,96,136,133,80,106,30,141,93,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
