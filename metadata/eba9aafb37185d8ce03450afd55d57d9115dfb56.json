To my heart's dismay, it troubles me deeply to find such devilish people and corruption among society.  There may be some that want to point their finger of blame at me for doing this, however, I cannot allow in good conscience remain silent and let these individuals continue to betray humanity and God.  There are too many &quot;Good Christians&quot; who are being hurt and led astray by these arrogant devil mongers.  They need to be exposed for what they are and help alert and prepare those indearing to God for the return of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.\n\nAfter searching for some time on the Internet, these 21 videos on The Toronto Blessing Unmasked are the best quality I could find.  But with that said, the audio could have been done better.  However, these videos really help expose the true Satanic worship involved with these various preachers.\n\n\n\nFalse spirits invade the church - KUNDALINI WARNING - Andrew Strom:\nTold by a genuine &quot;Insider,&quot; this is the true story of one of the most frightening &quot;invasions&quot; in the history of the church - and the fight to keep it out. Andrew Strom has been part of the Charismatic movement for over 25 years - and was deeply involved in the modern &quot;Prophetic&quot; movement for 11 of those years. He is the founder of RevivalSchool.com and the International REVIVAL List. In this book, Strom traces this mass invasion of false spirits back to 1994, and shows how it culminated in the bizarre events surrounding Todd Bentley and the Lakeland revival in 2008. What are 'Kundalini' spirits? What are the signs of their presence? And how can such an invasion be turned around? All this and more is discussed in this provocative book.\n\nReviews of his book include...  &quot;A 'MUST READ'&quot; - The Voice Magazine. &quot;The church of Jesus Christ does not realize that it has been infiltrated by demonic forces. Discernment has been lost! A book that is beyond needful.&quot; - Greg Gordon, Sermon Index.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011.
