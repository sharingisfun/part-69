Its nose is torn off as its landing gear crumples like a lame horse. Inside, unbelted occupants are tossed like rag dolls, and overhead bins spew luggage and electrical wiring into the cabin.\n\nThis is a real jetliner crash, but not a catastrophe. It's an intentional crash for the new Discovery Channel program Curiosity, which airs Sunday at 9 p.m. ET. In this case, university scientists and international investigators will get a rare second-by-second look at just what happens -- to the jet and to its occupants -- when something goes terribly wrong midflight.\n\nThis study could improve aviation safety, just as automotive crash-test dummies have for decades led to safer cars and fewer fatalities on the road. Scientists plan to mine the test results for at least a decade, writing reports and sharing the information with government regulators and industry representatives to make the 2.8 billion flights taken worldwide each year a bit safer.\n\n\nEnjoy and help to seed! else it will take ages","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd7bf94e3d13c1ca6cc7b80b2b02407de7f5602d","amp;dn":"Curiosity.S02E01.hdtv.xvid-%5D%5B+Plane+Crash+%5D%5B+08-Oct-2012+%5D+avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd7bf94e3d13c1ca6cc7b80b2b02407de7f5602d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,123,249,78,61,19,193,202,108,199,184,11,43,2,64,125,231,245,96,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
