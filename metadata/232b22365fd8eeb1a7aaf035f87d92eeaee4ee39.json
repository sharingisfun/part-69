Inspired by SKINNY PUPPY and MINISTRY, supported with screams and distorted vocals, ..CHRYSALIDE.., since 2003, is an uncompromising, unforgiving, perceptive, involved, raw, in-your-face, pure fucking tragic industrial poetic agression. Thematicaly anarchistic, manifesting indignation and raging against the fucked up condition of the world in the vein of the best of cyberpunk. \n\nLeaving aside any connotation of metal and rock to their cyberpunk elders, hip hop beats and dubstep martial basses announce the coupling of Alien and Cthulhu, the result of this monstrous copulation is a psychedelic butterfly, a black-winged sphinxes and a radioactive skull head, an insect that goes through your mouth open and disseminates all psychotropic molecules in most cells of your body.\n\nCouldn't find it anywhere else so I assembled it and uploaded it.\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:232b22365fd8eeb1a7aaf035f87d92eeaee4ee39","amp;dn":"Chrysalide+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"232b22365fd8eeb1a7aaf035f87d92eeaee4ee39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,43,34,54,95,216,238,177,167,170,240,53,248,125,146,238,174,228,238,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
