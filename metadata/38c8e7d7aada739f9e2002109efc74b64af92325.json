Annie (Jennifer Blanc) and her friend Mary (Danielle Harris) were just looking top party in the great outdoors when they hooked up with a pair of SheriffÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Deputies (Ryan Honey and Denny Kirkwood) who like to play rough. When Mary dies at one of their hands, lone witness Annie makes a narrow escape. Upon encountering Kyle (Beihn), a grizzled ex-con who lives alone in the woods, Annie begs for help in escaping her sadistic pursuers.
