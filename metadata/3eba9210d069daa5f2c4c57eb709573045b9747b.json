The scoring system allows tactics to be employed during the race. Accumulate score allows the use of nitro in the race and becomes extra time at the end of it. So the short-term use of nitro can help players get out of situations in front of others, but use a lot of nitro and therefore score can cost the race. There are different methods of accumulating score (taking advantage of the trails of vehicles hitting objects, skidding ...) and some cars are more suited to one method than the other. Choosing the right vehicle for the preferred method and carry out his strategy will make the player manages to win the race.\n\n\n\nInstallation:\n\n1. Unpack the release\n2. Mount or burn image\n3. Install\n4. Copy everything from the SKIDROW folder to the game installation\n5. Play the game \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3eba9210d069daa5f2c4c57eb709573045b9747b","amp;dn":"Ignite+%5BEnglish%5D%5BSKIDROW%5D++Team+Rjaa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3eba9210d069daa5f2c4c57eb709573045b9747b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,186,146,16,208,105,218,165,242,196,197,126,183,9,87,48,69,185,116,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
