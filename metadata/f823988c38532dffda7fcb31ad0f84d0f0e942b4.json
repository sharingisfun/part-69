His chest is branded with an ambigram of the word &quot;Illuminati&quot;. Kohler contacts Robert Langdon, an expert on the Illuminati, who determines that the ambigram is authentic. Kohler calls Vetra's adopted daughter Vittoria to the scene, and it is ascertained that the Illuminati have stolen a canister containing antimatter ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a substance with destructive potential comparable to a small nuclear weapon. When at CERN the canister is stored in a unique electrical charger which ensures the anti-matters stability but when removed its back-up battery provides power for 24 hours after which the anti-matter will self-destruct. The canister is somewhere in Vatican City, with a security camera in front of it, as its digital clock counts down to the explosion.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f823988c38532dffda7fcb31ad0f84d0f0e942b4","amp;dn":"Angels+and+Demons","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f823988c38532dffda7fcb31ad0f84d0f0e942b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,35,152,140,56,83,45,255,218,127,203,49,173,15,132,208,240,233,66,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
