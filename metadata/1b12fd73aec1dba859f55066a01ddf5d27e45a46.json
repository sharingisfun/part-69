I am limited monthly on amount of Bandwidth, so once I see 10-15 seeders, and after 8 hours or so, I remove the torrent since it maxes my daily bandwidth amount.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b12fd73aec1dba859f55066a01ddf5d27e45a46","amp;dn":"Lifetime-Steel+Magnolias+-+ReSeed+%5B2012%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b12fd73aec1dba859f55066a01ddf5d27e45a46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,18,253,115,174,193,219,168,89,245,80,102,160,29,223,93,39,228,90,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
