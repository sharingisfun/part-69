If everything is commodified, what do we lose as a society?\n\n[u]Should Money Buy Everything?[/u]\n\nEverything has value. Groceries. Cellphones. Now, in our market society, kidneys. What can't money buy? Do we want a society where everything is up for sale? Or are there certain moral and civic goods that markets do not honour and money cannot buy? The Agenda examines the true cost of putting a price tag on everything.\n\n[u]Guests:[/u]\n\n[b]Michael Sandel[/b] - Author, [i]What Money CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Buy: The Moral Limits of Markets[/i]\n\n[b]Ronald Beiner[/b] - Professor of Political Science, University of Toronto\n\t\n[b]Matt Welch[/b] -  Editor-in-Chief, Reason Magazine\n\n[b]John Tomasi[/b] - Professor of Political Science, Brown University\n\t\n[b]Michael Tomasky[/b] - Editor-in-Chief, Democracy &amp; Correspondent, Newsweek/Daily Beast\n\nFor more information on this episode, including information on the guests and various other resources and links, visit the episode webpage: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://theagenda.tvo.org/episode/183840/the-true-cost&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://theagenda.tvo.org/episode/183840/the-true-cost&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-----\n\nNote:  This is an iPod video podcast that is available for free download from the website.
