Marketing Licensing trailer for\nthe film.\n\nAnd taking up much of the space, there's scenes that only appear in Fred Calvert's\n&quot;The Princess and the Cobbler&quot; edit, and which don't appear in the later &quot;Arabian\nKnight&quot; edit of the film, released by Miramax and later the Weinstein Company.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce1b479ecf776d2a54480be784d6299c564bb3b0","amp;dn":"Random+Thief+and+the+Cobbler+Footage","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce1b479ecf776d2a54480be784d6299c564bb3b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,27,71,158,207,119,109,42,84,72,11,231,132,214,41,156,86,75,179,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
