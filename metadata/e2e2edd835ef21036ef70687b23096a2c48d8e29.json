The gameplay is very similar to that featured in Quake, in terms of movement and controls, although the player has been slowed down, and now has the ability to crouch. The game retains four of the original Quake's weapons (shotgun, super-shotgun, grenade-launcher and rocket launcher), although they were all redesigned and made to function in slightly different ways. The remainder of Quake's eight weapons (axe, nail-gun, super-nailgun and Thunderbolt) are gone. Newly introduced weapons are the blaster, machinegun, chaingun, hyperblaster, railgun and BFG10K. Some power-ups from Quake are still present, including quad damage.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2e2edd835ef21036ef70687b23096a2c48d8e29","amp;dn":"Quake+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2e2edd835ef21036ef70687b23096a2c48d8e29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,226,237,216,53,239,33,3,110,247,6,135,178,48,150,162,196,141,142,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
