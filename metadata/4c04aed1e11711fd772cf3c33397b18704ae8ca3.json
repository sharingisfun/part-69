With this program you can clean the disks of dust, remove invalid entries from the registry and defragment it, optimize memory, manage startup permanently delete files from the disc with a special tool &quot;TuneUp Shredder&quot; (further recovery becomes impossible, even with special programs), to recover deleted files, change the look of Windows, and much more. All utilities in this package integrated into a single graphical environment.\n\n\nThe new Start page\nTuneUp Utilities 2012 welcomes you with a completely redesigned Start page, which tells you about the status of your computer. If problems or nonoptimal settings are found, you are only a mouse-click away from resolving them. The Start page also tells you when new tips for increasing computer performance are available and warns you if maintenance tasks are not being taken care of automatically. The Start page also shows you whether new automatic startup programs have been added to Windows since the last time you ran TuneUp Utilities. You can decide whether these programs that start up automatically are really necessary.\n\nTuneUp Speed Optimizer\nWhich settings slow your computer down? Which unnecessary services or programs are running in the background? Is your Internet connection optimally configured? TuneUp Speed Optimizer knows the answers to all these questions. It examines your entire system for bottlenecks, superfluous background programs, and incorrect settings. Great: with just one click you can carry out most optimizations very quickly. In addition, TuneUp Speed Optimizer provides suggestions for speeding up your system.\n\nTuneUp Shortcut Cleaner\nCleaning up your working environment is tedious: removing invalid shortcuts from the Start menu, the Desktop, and the Quick Launch bar is very time-consuming. TuneUp ShortCut Cleaner now does the work for you. It checks whether all shortcuts are valid and removes the orphaned ones with just a click of a button. At the same time, empty folders are removed from the Start menu. TuneUp ShortCut Cleaner also checks frequently used programs and cleans up the list of recently opened files.\n\nSupport for the Opera browser\nAfter hard disk defragmentation, which we introduced in TuneUp Utilities 2009, the feature most requested by customers was support for the Opera browser. TuneUp Utilities 2010 now also includes full support for Opera. Via several special Opera settings, TuneUp System Control now allows you to change the number of Speed Dial entries, conveniently choose your default search engine, and reenable fast backward and forward navigation. Internet optimization lets you optimize Opera's performance for your Internet connection. Free up disk space lets you delete the Opera cache.\n\nTuneUp Styler\nNow you can also change the Vista logo animation which appears just before logon. You can download a whole series of great animations from the TuneUp website. Or, if you prefer, you can choose your own personal image to display while Vista starts up. With Vista, you can also add your own images to Vista's logon screen: With just a few mouse clicks you can create a truly personal logon experience.\n\nTuneUp Uninstall Manager\nRedesigned from the ground up, TuneUp Install Manager now runs much faster and has a new, even more intuitive interface so that it is even easier to uninstall unnecessary programs. Unnecessary programs often are forgotten because they were installed a long time ago and then not used. TuneUp Utilities 2009 shows you a list of programs not used for a long time so that you can target for uninstallation those applications that use valuable disk space and in certain circumstances even slow your system down.\n\nTuneUp StartUp Manager\nA smooth-running system results when there are no unnecessary autostart applications. The improved TuneUp Startup Manager organizes your programs into groups and provides clear explanations to make it easier for you to identify those programs that are not needed.New automatic startup programs are now highlighted so that you can disable unwanted entries more easily. System start tasks are now also listed in TuneUp StartUp Manager In Vista, in particular, scheduled tasks are used in place of autostart entries.\n\nFree up disk space\nThe already rapid display of disk space to be freed up is now even faster on NTFS drives. And now it is so easy to delete even more unnecessary files, like the backup files for the first Windows Vista service pack and the Opera and Safari caches. The second &quot;Free up disk space&quot; module that helps you turn off Windows functions that use excessive disk space has also been enhanced. The Windows Search index can now be disabled and deleted with a single click. This makes particular sense if you are already using a different search engine. In addition, TuneUp Disk Space Explorer now runs faster and no longer requires that an entire drive be analyzed. You can now specify that only those folders be analyzed that you are really interested in.\n\nLots more improvements\nAlong with the totally new features, there are a series of improvements that are not immediately visible. There are small improvements like Tooltips in the main window, a substantial increase in the number of problems that can be found byTuneUp Registry Cleaner, and better progress feedback from TuneUp Drive Defrag. But there are also big improvements &quot;under the hood&quot;. Two good examples are a completely reworked installation program and significant improvements in our update technology.\n\n\nHome Page - http://www.tune-up.com\n\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n*** When using TPB please read these important notes: \n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n01. AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their \n    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're \n    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not \n    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.\n\n02. To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack \n    or folder from being auto-protected &amp; auto-scanned by the AV software.\n\n03. If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored \n    (if it's not in Quarantine then look at History or something similar).\n\n04. To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.sandboxie.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.sandboxie.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6487418&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6487418&lt;/a&gt;\n\n05. Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.\n\n06. Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies \n    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.\n\n07. Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow \n    connections for lots of apps &amp; MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set \n    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.\n\n08. Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!\n\n09. Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads &amp; seeders in a short time \n    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.\n\n10. Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply \n    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.\n\n11. In general often there are more fake &amp; negative comments than reliable &amp; \n    positive comments.\n\n12. In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.\n\n13. Posting FAKE comments &amp; uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!\n\n14. Comments are welcome, unlike ranting, trolling, whining, etc.\n\n15. No Promises ... No Debts!\n\n\nFor reporting bad or suspicious torrents                                  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor my 1200+ torrents                                  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Anacondaz/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Anacondaz/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nTo the &quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users&quot;,\n\nNowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intentionally \nposting fake comments &amp; files. Their meaning is just trying to spread \nconfusion and to frustrate TPB and it's users. \nLess downloaders = less seeders = less download speed etc = not good! \n\nIt's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people \nwho intentionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files. It's an easy answer against \nthose who intentionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files, which is a never \nending issue. \n\nWhen reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for \none does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app \nand about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! \nLet's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said &amp; posted. \nThings are all up to you, the &quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users&quot;!\n\n\nEnjoy The Pirate Bay\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c04aed1e11711fd772cf3c33397b18704ae8ca3","amp;dn":"TuneUp_Utilities_2012_Build_12.0.2050.1_EN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c04aed1e11711fd772cf3c33397b18704ae8ca3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,4,174,209,225,23,17,253,119,44,243,195,51,151,177,135,4,174,140,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
