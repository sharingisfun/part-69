ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a catch! The fire only burns upwards, leaving you to tilt and turn the puzzle to keep your flame alive!\n\nAs you progress through the levels, you'll encounter bugs crawling along the rope. Different bugs have different reactions to the flame. For example, the ant changes the color of the flame so you can burn different colored ropes, and the spider shoots out a web bridge so you can access parts of the level that you could not before.\n\nBurn the Rope is incredibly fun and addictive. You will actually feel like you're burning a rope, yet there's no need for a fire extinguisher!\n\nFeatures:\n\n    180+ exciting levels with more coming every day !!!\n    Incredibly fun and addictive!\n    Unique controls!\n    Beautiful graphics and cool fire effects!\n    Easy to learn, hard to master!\n    Fun for the whole family!\n\nWhat's in this version : (Updated : Sep 12, 2012)\n\n    Another FREE level pack with 60 new levels added !!!\n    Added korean and chinese language support\n\nRequired Android O/S : 1.6+\n\n\n\n                                By bobiras2009\t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1d5419e7c40441119163df671806f549407c7db","amp;dn":"Burn+The+Rope%2B+v1.2.21+Final+By+bobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1d5419e7c40441119163df671806f549407c7db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,213,65,158,124,64,68,17,25,22,61,246,113,128,111,84,148,7,199,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
