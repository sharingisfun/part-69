Why ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gone from Ã¢â‚¬ËœYes we canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ to Ã¢â‚¬ËœEr, maybe we shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢tÃ¢â‚¬â„¢...\nLet us cast our minds back to those remarkable days in November 2008 when the son of a Kenyan goatherd was elected to the White House. It was a bright new dawn Ã¢â‚¬â€œ even brighter than the coming of the Kennedys and their new Camelot. JFK may be considered as being from an ethnic and religious minority Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Irish and Catholic Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but he was still very rich and very white. Barack Obama, by contrast, was a true breakthrough president. The world would change because obviously America had changed.\n\nObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s campaign slogan was mesmerisingly simple and brimming with self-belief: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Yes we can.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ His presidency, however, is turning out to be more about Ã¢â‚¬Å“no we wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Even more worryingly, it seems to be very much about: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Maybe we canÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ do what, exactly?Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The world feels like a dangerous place when leaders are seen to lack certitude but the only thing President Obama seems decisive about is his indecision. What should the US do about Libya? What should the US do about the Middle East in general? What about the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s crippling debts? What is the US going to do about Syria , Afghanistan, about Iran?\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bed55cefe0f301232a6f79f85565fd18c1803327","amp;dn":"THE+WEAKEST+PRESIDENT+IN+HISTORY.docx","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bed55cefe0f301232a6f79f85565fd18c1803327","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,213,92,239,224,243,1,35,42,111,121,248,85,101,253,24,193,128,51,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
