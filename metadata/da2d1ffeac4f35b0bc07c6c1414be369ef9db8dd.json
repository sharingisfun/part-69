But in 2003, six years into their marriage, the fairy tale crumbles when Jeff is found dead and buried in the backyard of their suburban home. The close-knit community is shocked as police accuse Susan of pre-meditated murder Ã¢â‚¬â€ luring her husband into the bedroom, tying him up and violently stabbing him almost 200 times before haphazardly cleaning up the crime scene. As JeffÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s family reels from the devastating news, Susan begins to mount her aggressive defense; that she needed to kill Jeff out of self-preservation for herself and her children after years of physical and mental abuse. But prosecutor Kelly Siegler is skeptical of her defense and forcefully argues she is a cunning, doe-eyed sociopath, who has used her good looks to try to get away with anything in life Ã¢â‚¬â€ even murderÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nGenre: Crime | Drama | Thriller\nIMDB Rating: 6.0/10 from 129 users\nDirected by: Stephen Kay\nStarring: Sara Paxton, Justin Bruening and Angela Arimento\n\nRelease Name: Blue-Eyed.Butcher.2012.STV.DVDRip.XviD-MARGiN\nSize: 700MB\nVideo: X264 | 640Ãƒâ€”352 | 942kbps\nAudio: English | MP3 | 128 kbps\nRuntime:89min\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://old.rapidimg.org/images/sAqCu.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://old.rapidimg.org/images/sAqCu.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://old.rapidimg.org/images/8xsOG.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://old.rapidimg.org/images/8xsOG.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://old.rapidimg.org/images/R0LM.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://old.rapidimg.org/images/R0LM.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://old.rapidimg.org/images/MaCP8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://old.rapidimg.org/images/MaCP8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://old.rapidimg.org/images/qtHsa.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://old.rapidimg.org/images/qtHsa.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da2d1ffeac4f35b0bc07c6c1414be369ef9db8dd","amp;dn":"Blue-Eyed+Butcher+2012+STV+DVDRip+XviD-MARGiN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da2d1ffeac4f35b0bc07c6c1414be369ef9db8dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,45,31,254,172,79,53,176,188,7,198,193,65,75,227,105,239,157,184,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
