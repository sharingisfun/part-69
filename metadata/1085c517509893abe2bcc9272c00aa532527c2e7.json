A producer extraordinaire hailing from London. This here is his premiere solo release and our second original. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been following our netBloc series for a while, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve most-likely heard Ã¢â‚¬Å“Is It Too Late For Us All?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ from the collaborative project that he was part of (along with BostonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own Tha Silent Partner), MUTE. It was featured on Ã¢â‚¬Å“netBloc Vol. 15: this album wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t eat your gas moneyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Welcome him back with what IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m quite confident youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll think is one fantastic release. Hip-Hop on another plainÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ from another perspectiveÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ but real boom bap hip-hop none-the-less. From the introduction Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ebony ShardsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ to Ã¢â‚¬Å“X ManÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not a boring or weak moment to be found.\n\nTo me Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Overcast ProjectÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ feels like the perfect follow-up to Just Plain AntÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dig DeepÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Formula seems to share a similar desire to expand the definition of Ã¢â‚¬Å“hip-hopÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. With Formula at itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s core and a talented group of musicians and emcees, Overcast gels into a superbly cohesive unit (much like AntÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s release before it). There IS a Ã¢â‚¬Å“Formula soundÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and each of the guest musicians and emcees lend their distinctive touches in such a way as to make the unit stronger.\n\nSit back and get ready for the journeyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ the sky may be overcast, but no rain is in the forecastÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ so enjoy the journey!\n\nThanks to Formula for allowing blocSonic to handle the release of this gem!\n\nAs always, thanks to you for visiting blocSonic and listening to our releasesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ rememberÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ share this with friends, enemies, parents, siblings, politicians, zombies and aliensÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ ohÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ and the rain godsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nPeace\n\nMike Gregoire\n\nFounder/Curator blocSonic.com\n\n\nThis audio is part of the collection: blocSonic\nIt also belongs to collection:\n\nArtist/Composer: Michael Gregoire\nDate: 2009-07-28\nKeywords: hip-hop; indepenent\n\nCreative Commons license: Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 3.0\n\nIndividual Files\nWhole Item \tFormat\tSize\n00-blocSonic_BSOG0002.pdf.zip \tZIP \t10.0 MB\n00-blocSonic_BSOG0002_192Kbs_MP3.zip \tZIP \t77.6 MB\n00-blocSonic_BSOG0002_320Kbs_MP3.zip \tZIP \t114.7 MB\n00-blocSonic_BSOG0002_Art_EPS_Format.zip \tZIP \t59.6 MB\n00-blocSonic_BSOG0002_Art_PDF_Format.zip \tZIP \t4.9 MB\n00-blocSonic_BSOG0002_Art_TIF_Format.zip \tZIP \t22.8 MB\n00-blocSonic_BSOG0002_FLAC.zip \tZIP \t280.1 MB\nBSOG0002_vbr.m3u \tVBR M3U \tStream\nBSOG0002_vbr_mp3.zip \tVBR ZIP \t55.5 MB\nAudio Files \tOgg Vorbis \t192Kbps MP3 \tVBR MP3\nEbony Shards (Intro) \t1.8 MB\n\t3.3 MB\n\t3.0 MB\nShipwreck (Featuring Zack S.
