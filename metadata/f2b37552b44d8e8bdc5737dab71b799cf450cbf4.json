DelayedLock is a solution to this problem: After unlocking your phone, it will turn the lock screen off for a user defined amount of time.\n\nYou can turn your phone off and on as often as you want without entering your password/PIN/pattern again. After a certain time, it will automatically reactivate your lockscreen, so no stranger can access your personal data.\n\nAdditionally, there is also a notification in the Android status bar and a widget to immediately reenable the lock screen.\n\nFeatures :\n\n    Delayes the requirement to enter pattern/PIN/password again after succesfully unlocked once \n    Delay since 'Screen off' or since 'Last unlock' \n    Ability to show a simple slider lockscreen when pattern/PIN/password lock is currently disabled \n    Delay &amp; customize the simple slider lock \n    Quickly re-enable the lock through the Android notification bar or a widget \n    Widgets &amp; Shortcuts: Toggle Lock, Screen off, Screen off &amp; Lock, Start Simple Lock \n    Upgradable with free plugins: Unlock with WiFi, Bluetooth or location based and remote activate lockscreen via SMS \n    compatible with HTC Sense &amp; WidgetLocker, should also work with Tasker &amp; Locale (untested, see Support-Thread) \n    music controls on simple lockscreen (works with Spotify, Winamp, Google Music and more) \n\nWhat's in this version: (Updated : Sep 16, 2012)\n\n    widgets not working after reboot fixed\n    fixed &quot;double lockscreen&quot; on some devices\n\nRequired Android O/S : 1.6+\n\n\n                                By bobiras2009\t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2b37552b44d8e8bdc5737dab71b799cf450cbf4","amp;dn":"Delayed+Lock+v2.8.2+Final+By+bobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2b37552b44d8e8bdc5737dab71b799cf450cbf4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,179,117,82,180,77,142,139,220,87,55,218,183,27,121,156,244,80,203,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
