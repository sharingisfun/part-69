They were taken from movies, console/PC games and TV series soundtracks. All of them are separated in different file folders by mood; mood definitions in brazilian portuguese first (since Im from Brazil), english definitions in parentesis. All files are in MP3 format with variable quality. \n\nI started downloading and sorting out soundtracks back in 2005 following a suggestion I saw in a website to help DMing and creating a ambience for the scenes. It was called &quot;The RPG Sound Project&quot;, but the website is no longer online. \n\nI hope you all like it! :)\n\n\n\nP.S.: I do not have any legal property over the files. This is for personal use only, they are not to be broadcasted and/or selled. All rigths over the sound files reserved belong to its composers and publishers.
