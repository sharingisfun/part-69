ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what Dr. Morgan Sterling believes. And sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to prove it by curing the zombie plague ravaging her cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s slums. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s certain itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not a sign of the End of Days, but a nasty diseaseÃ¢â‚¬â€until an angel appears in her morgue in a flash of glory. \n\nLuniel is not just a fallen angel. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a powerful warrior sworn to fight evil in hopes of a chance at redemption.
