One night with Van Helsing upstairs, his secretary, Solina (Jennifer Esposito), allows a group of thieves, led by her boyfriend, Marcus (Omar Epps), into the shop. The thieves infiltrate the shop's underground high-security vault and find a sealed silver coffin protected by a deadly defense system. Based on the level of security surrounding the coffin, Solina and Marcus decide that the coffinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s contents must be valuable, so they escape with it and flee to New Orleans, Louisiana. When Van Helsing discovers that the coffin has been stolen, he boards a plane to America, telling his apprentice, Simon Sheppard (Jonny Lee Miller), to remain in London. Simon does not follow his mentorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s orders and travels to Louisiana as well.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6e47728d16705c0899d54ebb63e9e40601e2161","amp;dn":"Dracula+2000","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6e47728d16705c0899d54ebb63e9e40601e2161","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,228,119,40,209,103,5,192,137,157,84,235,182,62,158,64,96,30,33,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
