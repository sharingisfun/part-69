Though none of these tracks were recorded at Motown's studios (only the vocals were), Merry Christmas was one of the label's best Christmas records; Diana Ross' charming innocence brought across the novelties (&quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,&quot; &quot;Twinkle Twinkle Little Me&quot;) as well as the sacred tunes (&quot;Born of Mary,&quot; &quot;Children's Christmas Song&quot;), and the harmony backing of Mary Wilson and Florence Ballard made the Supremes' version of &quot;White Christmas&quot; the best ever by a rock group. The four bonus tracks bring together Christmas songs from several Motown compilations (Christmas in the City, Never Before Released Masters) as well as the previously unreleased &quot;Noel.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7f3db2c9d19c93f809a102947fb24ffb3ca73c7","amp;dn":"The+Supremes+-+20th+Century+Masters%3A+The+Christmas+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7f3db2c9d19c93f809a102947fb24ffb3ca73c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,243,219,44,157,25,201,63,128,154,16,41,71,251,36,255,179,202,115,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
