Southampton's great start to the season is put to the test \nwhen they travel to the Ricoh Arena to face Coventry City. Elsewhere, two of the form teams of the \ndivision, Hull City and West Ham, meet at the KC Stadium. Two seasons ago, this was a \nPremier League fixture and given that it finished three-three back then it's a result that neutrals \nwould love to see repeated. Meanwhile, having left Portsmouth to join Nottingham Forest, \nmanager Steve Cotterill returns to Fratton Park with both teams desperate for the win that would \nease them away from the relegation places. Presented by Manish Bhasin.\n\n\n..","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5400edac8ea0db9235b8ca171c90810edce71e5b","amp;dn":"The+Football+League+Show+-+5th+November+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5400edac8ea0db9235b8ca171c90810edce71e5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,0,237,172,142,160,219,146,53,184,202,23,28,144,129,14,220,231,30,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
