Moom's panel appears, and you then click the desired action.\n\nWhen used via the keyboard, a hot key displays the Moom bezel, and you can then use the arrow and modifier keys to move and resize the windows.\n\nYou can also save window layouts, create custom controls with shortcuts that work globally or work only when Moom's keyboard bezel is onscreen.\n\nWhats New\n\n* Fixes a regression where Moom wouldn't work properly with apps that don't fully support the Accessibility API.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nMac Intel, OS version: Mac OS X 10.6 or later\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ---","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be25790ba03a1c91661031401800d5556ebec4ab","amp;dn":"Moom+v.+2.3.2+%2B+SK+Patch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be25790ba03a1c91661031401800d5556ebec4ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,37,121,11,160,58,28,145,102,16,49,64,24,0,213,85,110,190,196,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
