NFO .............\n-Revolution.2012.S01E01.720p.HDTV.X264-DIMENSION\nAired 17.09.2012\n\n&quot;Pilot&quot;\n\nOur entire way of life depends on electricity. \nSo what would happen if it just stopped \nworking? Well, one day, like a switch turned \noff, the world is suddenly thrust back into the \ndark ages. Planes fall from the sky, hospitals \nshut down, and communication is impossible. And \nwithout any modern technology, who can tell us \nwhy? Now, 15 years later, life is back to what \nit once was long before the industrial \nrevolution: families living in quiet cul-de-\nsacs, and when the sun goes down lanterns and \ncandles are lit. Life is slower and sweeter. Or \nis it? On the fringes of small farming \ncommunities, danger lurks. And a young woman's \nlife is dramatically changed when a local \nmilitia arrives and kills her father, who \nmysteriously - and unbeknownst to her - had \nsomething to do with the blackout. This brutal \nencounter sets her and two unlikely companions \noff on a daring coming-of-age journey to find \nanswers about the past in the hopes of \nreclaiming the future. \n\n18/Slower\nEvolve... or die.\n\nEnjoy :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d88dc78c7cc08f426721bd7e56986be2acc87a68","amp;dn":"Revolution.2012.S01E01.720p.HDTV.X264-DIMENSION","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d88dc78c7cc08f426721bd7e56986be2acc87a68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,141,199,140,124,192,143,66,103,33,189,126,86,152,107,226,172,200,122,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
