But they're the same generals we know in name only: their appearance, personality, and gender are all different. One day, first Oda Nobunaga and then all the others are transported to our world. Everything is new to them - bicycles, cell phones, automatic doors. Each episode focuses on one general and how she learns to adapt to the modern world.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33dbcbc59631811eda865071699080de343f38eb","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+Sengoku+Collection+-+24+%5B480p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33dbcbc59631811eda865071699080de343f38eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,219,203,197,150,49,129,30,218,134,80,113,105,144,128,222,52,63,56,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
