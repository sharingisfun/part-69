It contains tracks we had almost completely forgotten during the years buried deep in the jungle.\n\nSome of these tracks are old and certainly have a vibe-of-an-era. It also contains some tracks which were originally intended for our Finally-album but didnÃ‚Â´t fit the overall sound.\n\nSo we decided to give all of these for you as a gift - simply because of your positive feedback and staying with us during these years. L.A.O.S is all about you, and you are the reason we still are so driven making music.\n\nThese songs are free for you to share and care, all weÃ‚Â´re asking is that you spread the love.\n\nThank you.\n\nJayem/Abraham/D-Bex/Alexx = L.A.O.S 2012\nReleased by: Liquicity Records\nRelease/catalogue number: LIQFREE001 \n\n\n\nYou can also download here:","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22167475d498f45e98da8c09a9cb0bb487d626ae","amp;dn":"LAOS+-+Retrospective+%5B2005-2012+works%5D+%5BDrum%27n%27bass%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22167475d498f45e98da8c09a9cb0bb487d626ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,22,116,117,212,152,244,94,152,218,140,9,169,203,11,180,135,214,38,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
