This year's theme was the 80s. And here are the movies:\n\nGalaxy of Terror (1981)\nQ - The Winged Serpent (1982)\nNightbeast (1982)\nTwilight Zone - The Movie (1983)\nThe Deadly Spawn (1983)\nThe Toxic Avenger (1984)\nThe Stuff (1985)\nMaking Contact (1985)\nTeen Wolf (1985)\nSpookies (1986)\nTerrorVision (1986)\nFrom Beyond (1986)\nThe Gate (1987)\nPumpkinhead (1988)\nPuppetmaster (1989)\nKiller Klowns from Outer Space (1988)\n\nI did not make any of the rips myself, only the compiling. Most of them are DVD-rips around 700 megs, a few are VHS, one is blue ray (Teen Wolf).\n\nAll movies are in english. There are no subtitles.\n\nThere are no kind of archiving used, so you easily can select single movies to donwload if you like.\n\nOn a footnote; this distribution is in no way endorsed by Cinemassacre or James Rolfe and does not include any rips of his review videos. However, you can find them all on this URL:\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30204d609006cc513a77f4b751b5529e390b195d","amp;dn":"Monster+Madness+2012+-+80%27s-A-Thon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30204d609006cc513a77f4b751b5529e390b195d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,32,77,96,144,6,204,81,58,119,244,183,81,181,82,158,57,11,25,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
