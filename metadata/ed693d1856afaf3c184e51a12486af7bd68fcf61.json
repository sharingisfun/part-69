The material was released in the United Kingdom on 8 December 1967 as a six-track double EP on the Parlophone label\n\nThe number of songs used in the film posed a problem for The Beatles and their UK record company EMI, as there were too few for an LP album but too many for an EP. One idea considered was to issue an EP which played at 33Ã¢â€¦â€œ rpm but this would have caused a loss of fidelity that was deemed unacceptable. The solution chosen was to issue an innovative format of two EP's packaged in a gatefold sleeve with a 28-page booklet containing the lyrics and colour pictures. Of the package, Bob Neaverson wrote &quot;While it certainly solved the song quota problem, one suspects that it was also partly born of The Beatles' pioneering desire to experiment with conventional formats and packaging&quot;.[4] The package was released in the UK on 8 December, in time for the Christmas market, at the sub Ã‚Â£1 price of 19s 6d (equivalent to Ã‚Â£13 today).\n\nDouble EP - Track Listing [320k MP3]\n\n   &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; \n   &quot;Your Mother Should Know&quot;\n   &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot;\n   &quot;The Fool on the Hill&quot; \n   &quot;Flying&quot;\n   &quot;Blue Jay Way&quot; \n\nTotal length: 19:08  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed693d1856afaf3c184e51a12486af7bd68fcf61","amp;dn":"The+Beatles+-+Magical+Mystery+Tour+EP+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed693d1856afaf3c184e51a12486af7bd68fcf61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,105,61,24,86,175,175,60,24,78,81,161,36,134,175,123,214,143,207,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
