He travels    \n    to meet duck and quail egg producers who are trying to    \n    revive the fortunes of these once popular eggs. Among      \n    the dishes he creates in the Revival kitchen is a         \n    magnificent sponge cake made with duck eggs which looks  \n    nothing less than spectacular.                            \n                                                               \n    Irish-born chef Richard Corrigan is a keen fisherman      \n    and is passionate about fresh fish but he is shocked to  \n    discover that we export the vast majority of our          \n    mackerel catch. He is determined to change our             \n    attitudes to this rather overlooked fish by proving       \n    that not only is it incredibly good for us but that it   \n    tastes delicious too. He devises a range of wonderful     \n    recipes which showcase the benefits of cooking with        \n    locally caught fresh mackerel.                            \n                                                               \n      \n\n      \n            .  . ..: RiPPER/RELEASE NOTES :.. .  .           \n                                                              \n          &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b017040n&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b017040n&lt;/a&gt;            \n                                                              \n      &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.tvrage.com/Great_British_Food_Revival&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.tvrage.com/Great_British_Food_Revival&lt;/a&gt;      \n                                                              \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                             \n      \n\n                                             \n                  ..: GROUP NEWS/CONTACT :..  \n                                                           \n                                                      \n       SFM is dedicated to bringing you high quality     \n      TVRips and DVDRips of popular series and movies for   \n                     your viewing pleasure!                 \n                                                           \n       We are currently looking for:                       \n       - 100+ Mbit EU dump site for exclusive SFM usage   \n       - HDTV/PDTV cappers                                \n       - Crates &amp; Kegs of Beer (full of course)          \n                                                         \n                  .  . ..: GREETZ :.. .  .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da643a242e5bafda67df9efb77254953de98f6ee","amp;dn":"Great.British.Food.Revival.S02E04.720p.HDTV.x264-SFM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da643a242e5bafda67df9efb77254953de98f6ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,100,58,36,46,91,175,218,103,223,158,251,119,37,73,83,222,152,246,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
