Current and historical documentary footage shows children playing these games.[2] The story is brought to the present with discussions of the current role of street games and opinions as to what kids lose by not having the freedom to play without adult supervision, most importantly the social skills developed when kids could play in the streets.\n\n\nNew York Street Games.avi\n2.16 GiB, 1h 15mn\nXviD, 3 925 Kbps, 852 x 480 pixels, 16:9, 23.976 fps\nMP3, 128 Kbps CBR, 44.1 KHz\n\nEnglish Audio/No Subtitles\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img716.imageshack.us/img716/997/3y2a1v0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img716.imageshack.us/img716/997/3y2a1v0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img826.imageshack.us/img826/3619/9d6q0b4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img826.imageshack.us/img826/3619/9d6q0b4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img269.imageshack.us/img269/8421/0j9n6r8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img269.imageshack.us/img269/8421/0j9n6r8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img198.imageshack.us/img198/7729/3h7e5c3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img198.imageshack.us/img198/7729/3h7e5c3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img341.imageshack.us/img341/9148/nysgpost.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img341.imageshack.us/img341/9148/nysgpost.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img801.imageshack.us/img801/4086/3r9v0s6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img801.imageshack.us/img801/4086/3r9v0s6.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7bc324a7c3e72009776ae1f0d0f4b5a8766043f","amp;dn":"New+York+Street+Games+%5B2010-XViD-MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7bc324a7c3e72009776ae1f0d0f4b5a8766043f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,188,50,74,124,62,114,0,151,118,174,31,13,15,75,90,135,102,4,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
