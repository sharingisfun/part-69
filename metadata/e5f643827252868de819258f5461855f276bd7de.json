It's an exciting and creative concept that addresses the insights gleaned from our research in a very innovative way, adding that the animations would create a more demographically accessible face for McLaren.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5f643827252868de819258f5461855f276bd7de","amp;dn":"McLaren+Animation+Tooned+Episode+8+Lecture+Circuit.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5f643827252868de819258f5461855f276bd7de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,246,67,130,114,82,134,141,232,25,37,143,84,97,133,95,39,107,215,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
