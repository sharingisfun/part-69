It is the title track and first single from the band's eighth full-length studio album Funplex. The single was released to iTunes Store's internationally as a digital download on 29 January 2008.\n\nLyrics in the song, &quot;Private propertyÃ¢â‚¬â€œhippie be quiet / Your peace sign t-shirt / Could cause a riot&quot; refer to the 2003 Crossgates Mall T-shirt censorship controversy.\n\nThis music video was filmed in West Hollywood on March 1, 2008 and featured a cameo appearance at the end by RuPaul, who appeared in the video for &quot;Love Shack&quot;. The video features the band performing in a CGI shopping mall and premiered on MySpace on March 26, 2008.\n\nThe B-52s are an American rock band, formed in Athens, Georgia in 1976. The original line-up consisted of Fred Schneider (vocals, cowbell), Kate Pierson (vocals, keyboards), Cindy Wilson (vocals, tambourine, bongos), Ricky Wilson (guitar), and Keith Strickland (drums). Following Ricky Wilson's death in 1985 Strickland switched to guitar.\n\nRooted in New Wave and 1960s rock and roll, the group later covered many genres ranging from post-punk to pop rock. The &quot;guy vs. gals&quot; vocals of Schneider, Pierson, and Wilson, sometimes used in call and response style (&quot;Strobe Light,&quot; &quot;Private Idaho&quot;, and &quot;Good Stuff&quot;), are a trademark. Presenting themselves as a positive, enthusiastic, slightly oddball party band, the B-52s tell tall tales, glorify wild youth, and celebrate wild romance. The band name had long been &quot;The B-52's&quot;, until 2008 when they dropped the apostrophe and are now &quot;The B-52s&quot;.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funplex_(song)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funplex_(song)&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/MADpHAaEj&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/MADpHAaEj&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic: \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 8000kbps\n   Audio: PCM 48000Hz stereo 1536kbps [DVD LPCM, 16 bit]\n   Duration: 00:05:02\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
