The name is a synonymous of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCompact Distro LinuxÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. It is small in size, yet rich in features.\nYou can use CDlinux as your ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMobile OSÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Install it onto a USB key, take it anywhere and turn any PC/Mac that supports booting from USB to your own workstation, with the same user interface. CDlinux ships with an up-to-date version of the Linux kernel, Xorg, Xfce, and many popular applications, like Firefox, Pidgin, GIMP, and even Java and Wine. Just work anywhere like at home.\nYou can also use CDlinux as a handy admin/rescue tool. For this purpose, the much smaller ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œstandardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ edition is enough. The standard edition bundled with a lot of popular admin/rescue tools, like parted, partimage, partclone, testdisk, foremost, ext3grep, e2undel, e2fs/jfs/hfs/ntfs/reiserfs/vfat/xfs tools, and much more. Enough for your routine admin/rescue work. \nCDlinux has good i18n/locale support. Currently de_DE, en_CA, en_GB, en_US, fr_CA, fr_CH, fr_FR, ja_JP, ru_RU, zh_CN, and zh_TW are fully supported. And users can easily configure CDlinux to support their own locales. \n... &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://cdlinux.info/wiki/doku.php/about&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://cdlinux.info/wiki/doku.php/about&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThis is a development release. Built with our new, gcc-4.6 based toolchain. In fact, every bit in 0.9.7 was rebuilt from scratch. And almost all components were upgraded to their latest stable version.\nOur tests show that, this release is already quite stable and ready for general use. But to ensure long-term production use, more tests and fine-tunings are still needed.\nMajor user noticeable changes in 0.9.7 are:\n      SquashFS-4: 0.9.7 now uses the new squashfs 4 filesystem. As a result, your old .md files won\\'t be recognized by default. If you want to convert your squashfs 3 .md files to squashfs 4, please use \\'unsquashfs3\\'and \\'mksquashfs\\'(shipped with 0.9.7).\n      Hybrid ISO: You can \\'dd\\' the 0.9.7 ISO image onto a USB stick, and boot from it.\n      Amount: CDlinux\\' own hotplug solution to replace hal/udisks. It\\'s (hopefully) simple and stupid, and may needs more fine-tunings.\n\nThe package upgrade list is huge, some major ones:\n      linux-3.1\n      glibc-2.14.1\n      gcc-4.6.2\n      xorg-server-1.11.2\n      firefox-8.0\n\nThe Standard Edition can be found at SourceForge.net. All other editions and optional add-on modules can be downloaded from the download page.  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://cdlinux.info/wiki/doku.php/download/latest&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://cdlinux.info/wiki/doku.php/download/latest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://cdlinux.info/wiki/doku.php/news/latest&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://cdlinux.info/wiki/doku.php/news/latest&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.cdlinux.info/wiki/doku.php/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.cdlinux.info/wiki/doku.php/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nsha1sum : 6c5f09a7681b9b4831ed4f33c2e742fb8f09020d  CDlinux_mini-0.9.7.iso\nmd5sum : 7c2554be978b0e90528d8a8d55d5f6b9  CDlinux_mini-0.9.7.iso","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66687f1e2784300639d57ca3c6e1a3b927916b7e","amp;dn":"CDlinux_mini-0.9.7.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66687f1e2784300639d57ca3c6e1a3b927916b7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,104,127,30,39,132,48,6,57,213,124,163,198,225,163,185,39,145,107,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
