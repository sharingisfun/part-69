PC game is a Duel Monsters card game, written in Visual Basic for the Windows 95 or higher operating system. The game will seek to emulate the actual card game more faithfully than the Gameboy Color versions of the game. In it, the player will be able to meet the characters made famous in the comic, and duel them for cards. There will also be several original characters and cards created specifically for this game. The Gameboy Advance games (Duel Monsters 5 and 6) will give you a more &quot;faithful&quot; adaption of the DM game, but this game is far faster.
