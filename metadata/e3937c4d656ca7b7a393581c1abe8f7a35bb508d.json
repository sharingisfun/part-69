Apparently NBC didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think so, because the proposed series doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t seem to have a green light from NBC. Instead, the network aired this pilot on Friday evening. It was smart and colorful Ã¢â‚¬â€ which makes sense, since producer Bryan Fuller (Pushing Daisies) was behind it, but it also didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t feel as though all of its elements had come together to make it clear where such a weekly series might go.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3937c4d656ca7b7a393581c1abe8f7a35bb508d","amp;dn":"Mockingbird+Lane+S01E01+Pilot+720p+HuluRIP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3937c4d656ca7b7a393581c1abe8f7a35bb508d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,147,124,77,101,108,167,183,163,147,88,28,26,190,143,122,53,187,80,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
