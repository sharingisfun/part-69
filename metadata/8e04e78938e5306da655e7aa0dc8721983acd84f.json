After Hisako is reunited with her parents, she and Emma agree to go to the Xavier Institute to receive a vaccine to prevent 'Damon-Hall Syndrome' in secondary mutations. \nBeast announces that he wants to take Emma back to New York to study her secondary mutation. After much debate, Cyclops gives into the groups wishes. En route back to New York, the Blackbird is attacked by a mutant suffering from \nDHS which Wolverine defeats. Emma recognises him as a student from the Inner Circle's preparatory school. Upon returning to the Institute, Beast tries to investigate the boy's condition, but he shrivels up and dies. Beast concludes that the cause of his secondary mutation was not due to experimentation but some other stimulus. As Beast performs checks on Emma, Xavier reveals Cerebro is still being blocked from TÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½hoku. With Emma's secondary mutation on the same level as the boy, though hers is deemed harmless, Xavier suspects something is still going on in TÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½hoku which is causing these mutations.  \n\nSpoken Language:- English\n\n=============================\n\nScreenshots\n-----------\n\n[URL=http://img528.imageshack.us/i/xmen104transformationoj.jpg/][IMG]http://img528.imageshack.us/img528/4140/xmen104transformationoj.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n================================\n\nFile Info\n----------\n\n              ===== File Info ===== \nFileSize           : 176M\nPlayTime           : 00:20:58.725\nVideoCount         : 1\nAudioCount         : 1\n              ===== Video Info ===== \nVideo 0# Stream\nVideoCodec         : XVID\nVideoWidth         : 720 piexs\nVideoHeight        : 420 piexs\nVideoFrameRate     : 29.970fps\nVideoFrameCount    : 37724\nVideoBitRate       : 1035415\n              ===== Audio Info ===== \nAudio 0# Stream\nAudioCodec         : MP3\nAudioBitRate       : 128000\nAudioChannels      : 2\nAudioSampleRate    : 44100\n\n\nFormat:- AVI\n\n=============================\n\nHash\n-----\n8E04E78938E5306DA655E7AA0DC8721983ACD84F\n[/center]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e04e78938e5306da655e7aa0dc8721983acd84f","amp;dn":"X-Men+-+104+-+Transformation+%5BOj%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e04e78938e5306da655e7aa0dc8721983acd84f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,4,231,137,56,229,48,109,166,85,231,170,13,200,114,25,131,172,216,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
