This is an elegiac piece in which Barbara Sonnenborn visits battlefields decades later and talks with Vietnamese about their memories of what happened. Since her own husband died there, the film has a deeply personal meaning for her.\n\nNominated for an Oscar.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fdf1bb671ee69e552aba8ad9dd3e87ce57ab37b","amp;dn":"Regret+to+Inform+%281998%29+Barbara+Sonnenborn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fdf1bb671ee69e552aba8ad9dd3e87ce57ab37b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,223,27,182,113,238,105,229,82,171,168,173,157,211,232,124,229,122,179,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
