NRS sponsored &quot;Mission: Epicocity&quot; follows the adventures of NRS team members Karl Moser, LJ Groth, Trip Jennings, and the rest of the EP Crew as they search for exactly that. The mission would take them to the US, Canada, Africa, and South America. It would challenge the crew's limits on and off the water, and in the end, push the limits of the sport.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c9a15c33ccd8321c5fb668339bd6daaf7159674","amp;dn":"Mission.Epicocity","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c9a15c33ccd8321c5fb668339bd6daaf7159674","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,154,21,195,60,205,131,33,197,251,102,131,57,189,109,170,247,21,150,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
