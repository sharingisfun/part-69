Picky, Fickle, Vocal, Wired, and Vain ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ they have very little tolerance for error and are ready to spread the word quickly over the internet when things go wrong. If a companyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s customer service doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t adapt to these new conditions, they will get burned by bloggers and viral videos that can severely damage their reputation.\n\nThis book describes exactly what todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s customers expect and how to give it to them. In Wired and Dangerous, Bell and Patterson provide a tested formula for restoring balance to the customer relationship by establishing what they call ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œService CalmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. The three steps to Service Calm sound simple, but they draw on sophisticated psychological principles and are profound in application: 1) Deal with Self, 2) Deal with Customer, 3) Deal with Context.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1fdc754fdaebc6c3764d0e235896de84705206b","amp;dn":"Wired+and+Dangerous%3A+How+Your+Customers+Have+Changed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1fdc754fdaebc6c3764d0e235896de84705206b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,253,199,84,253,174,188,108,55,100,208,226,53,137,109,232,71,5,32,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
