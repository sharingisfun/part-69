Driven by a restless urge to conquer new women, use them, and throw them away, he has hired his friend Leporello to help create a masterpiece: A filmed database of all the women whose dreams Juan has shattered. We follow Juan and Leporello through 24 compressed hours. Juan seduces the young upper-class girl Anna, but ends up accidentally killing her father, a powerful police commissioner. The two friends run away, but JuanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s constant need to seduce new women keeps interrupting their flight. As the police gains in on them, Juan also steals the young bride Zerlina from her groom Masetto, and soon a feverish manhunt is on for Juan.\n\nGenre: Drama | Musical | Romance\nIMDB rating: 6.6/10\nDirected by: Kasper Holten\nStarring: Christopher Maltman, Mikhail Petrenko and Elizabeth Futral\n\nRelease Name: Juan.2010.DVDRiP.XViD-RCDiVX\nSize: 1 CD (700 MB)\nQuality: 592ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€320, 847 kbps, MP3 128 kbps\nRuntime: 100 mins ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29809b01b8e9c327bcf1cf34dd560ca363080593","amp;dn":"Juan.2010.DVDRiP.XViD-RCDiVX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29809b01b8e9c327bcf1cf34dd560ca363080593","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,128,155,1,184,233,195,39,188,241,207,52,221,86,12,163,99,8,5,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
