Sargent Shriver invented a string of social initiatives that shaped an era and dared millions of young Americans to live out their ideals. Those who knew himÃ¢â‚¬â€Bill Moyers, Andrew Young, political commentator Mark Shields, and so many othersÃ¢â‚¬â€have spoken of Shriver in the same breath as Martin Luther King, Jr., calling him a visionary of deep humanity who helped create a more just society.\n\nAmerican Idealist brings Shriver's story to life in this documentary which aired nationally on PBS on January 21, 2008. A powerful 90-minute depiction of practical activism, it offers a hopeful vision of what this nation could be and could do, based on the experience of what it once did when pushed by the civil rights movement and guided by the War on Poverty.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f007e8555c1b09bc370a398b2c239cfb1257802","amp;dn":"AMERICAN+IDEALIST%3A+THE+STORY+OF+SARGENT+SHRIVER+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f007e8555c1b09bc370a398b2c239cfb1257802","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,0,126,133,85,193,176,155,195,112,163,152,178,194,57,207,177,37,120,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
