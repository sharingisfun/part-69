Unlike some patcher-based programming environments, AudioMulch's modules perform high-level musical functions, so you don't have to create things from the ground up using individual oscillators and filters. AudioMulch is designed for live performance and improvisation - you can process live audio sources and control every knob and slider on the user interface using a MIDI controller.\n\n\n\nChanges:\n\nAdded 16 channel Matrix and Mixer contraptions.\nAdded right-click for Matrix contraption grid cells allowing Automate, Quick-map and direct access to parameters in the Parameter Control window for each grid cell.\nFixed bug where automation loop was sometimes skipped when the audio driver buffer size was not a multiple of 64 samples.\nFixed input/key meters on Limiter, NoiseGate and Compressor to reflect the input level after InputGain has been applied.\nFixed bug where patch was sometimes scrolled off screen when it was first opened.\nFixed bug in Flanger contraption that caused audio drop outs, extreme CPU load and crashes when using low Frequency Range settings when the audio interface sample rate was set to 96kHz or higher.\nAdded code to san\n\n\n\n\nAudioMulch 2.2.2 works with \n\nWindows XP, Vista and Windows 7. \nIt does not work with Windows 98. \nWindows 2000 is not officially supported but it works with a few minor display glitches. \n\n\n\nINSTALLATION:\n\n    Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Next unrar files.\n      If you can't open it you need to get an archiver which supports\n      rar files such as Winrar.\n\n    Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Click on extract and then run the setup to install.\n\n    Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Go to crack folder and copy the crack to the installation dir by default*\nC / program files / AudioMulch / and paste replacing the original.\n\n\n\n          Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ That's it! Done.\n\n                    3Nj0Y!!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02b46ea5a8e7a8a8410b0ed070fd36571bc27cc3","amp;dn":"Ross+Bencina+AudioMulch+v2.2.2+-+CHAOS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02b46ea5a8e7a8a8410b0ed070fd36571bc27cc3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,180,110,165,168,231,168,168,65,11,14,208,112,253,54,87,27,194,124,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
