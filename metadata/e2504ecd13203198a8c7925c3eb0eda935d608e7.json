As always, you need to have a USB flash drive with 4GB or more disk space to use the drive for this operation.\n \nPlease note that the tool should be launched as administrator. To do this, right-click on Windows 8 USB Installer Maker and then click Run as administrator. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t forget to backup data from the USB drive before using to make bootable media.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2504ecd13203198a8c7925c3eb0eda935d608e7","amp;dn":"Windows+8+USB+Installer.+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2504ecd13203198a8c7925c3eb0eda935d608e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,80,78,205,19,32,49,152,168,199,146,92,62,176,237,169,53,214,8,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
