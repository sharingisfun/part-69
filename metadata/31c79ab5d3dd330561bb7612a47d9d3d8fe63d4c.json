It operates outside the control of Congress and manipulates the credit of the United States&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Sen. Barry Goldwater (Rep. AR)\n\n&quot;I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies. Already they have raised up a monied aristocracy that has set the government at defiance. The issuing power (of money) should be taken away from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs.&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Thomas Jefferson, U.S. President.\n\n&quot;History records that the money changers have used every form of abuse, intrigue, deceit, and violent means possible to maintain their control over governments by controlling money and it's issuance.&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ James Madison.\n\n&quot;It is well that the people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning.&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Henry Ford\n\nTO DEFEAT EVIL WE MUST UNITE AND BRING BACK COMMUNITY FARMING EVERY COUNTRY SHOULD BE SELF SUBSTAINABLE PLUS WOULD CREATE JOBS AND WE CAN STOP WORLD HUNGER IT MAKES NO SENSE FOR MILLIONS OF PEOPLE STILL DYING FROM STARVATION IN THE YEAR 2011...AND WE MUST STOP LYING TO OUR CHILDREN AND TEACH THEM REAL HISTORY AND EXPLAIN THE REAL ENEMY OF AMERICA AND THE WORLD WHO CONTROL THE MONEY AND ROB US OF OUR RIGHTS AND OUR LAND AND AT THE END OF THE DAY THEY SPIT IN OUR FACE AND OUR ANCESTORS FACE BY SAYING WE ARE IN DEBT AFTER THEY STOLE ALL THE MONEY AND BOUGHT UP ALL THE GOLD....WAKE UP PEOPLE, LETS TAKE BACK AMERICA AND OUR PLANET BY SPREADING THE TRUTH AND ROOTING OUT THE EVIL BANKSTERS WHO CONTROL AMERICA AND THE WORLD BY HIDING BEHIND THE AMERICAN FLAG/FEDERAL RESERVE BANK/WORLD BANK/IMF/ISRAEL...WATCH MY VIDEOS TO SEE THE TRUTH WHY AMERICA IS NOT IN DEBT!!! ANYBODY WHO SAYS THAT IS A DOMESTIC TERRORIST UNTIL WE SORT THE FACTS AND SEE WHO HAS BEEN STEALING MONEY.... Occupy Wall Street Protest #OccupyWallStreet\n\n\nReviewer's Notes:\nAll is NOT what it seems being controlled by the elite behind the scenes. These protests are transitioning the World into a Socialist State under the appearance of wealth re-distribution, while the Protestors' DEMANDS are to create Subjects Of The State. DO NOT fall for this. It's ALL a ploy laid by the NWO agenda for global dominance.\n\nNothing good will come from this and to bring order from chaos is simply impossible (scientifically or otherwise) and a tactic they've used throughout history.  This is the beginning and has now gone global.  More is to come and watch for changes, including some global event which is not limited to a horrible natural looking event or Middle East war campaign.  Regardless, it's happening and best case scenario is to prepare for the forthcoming changes. Buy Silver or Gold (silver is much cheaper and given the upcoming monetary collapse, its value will increase significantly allowing individuals to continue to buy or sell until some future stability is reached.  Preferrably, buy enough to pay for your mortgage or rent, food and necessaties for at least one year, if not two years.\n\nThe 60's flower/hippie movement was another similar kind of protests and you'll notice the same type of on goings at these events.  Those protests were created by the Elite as well. Let's see, the result of which broght us CIA developed and distributed drugs, Free Sex and Masterbation, Abortion as right to legally kill, breakup of the family unit, working on weekends, precursor to a Global Recession, satanic Rock 'n Roll music corruption, more political and banking problems of today, including but not limited increased taxation and etc. Many have no clue, especially from a Biblical standpoint.  IT'S NOT ABOUT POLITICAL PARTIES OR SO-CALLED LIBERTARIANS. That's FAKE! Enjoy your NWO or DO NOT SACRIFICE YOUR FREEDOMS FOR A FALSE SENSE/APPEARANCE OF SECURITY.  It's your choice.  \n\nHere in the U.S. the protestors' are only attempting to confront and/or confuse the true problems which are inflicted on the people.  Their fighting only some of the symptoms and not the true underlying factors of dealing with the real problem - Defending and reclaiming our Constiitution and Legal Rights therein.  Don't join one of their clubs but make the right move and take a stance for the Republic and reclaim your Constitutional rights!\n\n\nThe Wave - 1981 A True Story, The NAZI Experiment (Mind Control/Manipulation):\nBased on a true story, a teacher plays a mental game with some of his students.  To explain to his students the atmosphere in the 1930's Nazi-Germany, history teacher Burt Ross initiates a daring experiment. He declares himself leader of a new movement, called 'The Wave'. Inspired, he proclaims ideas about Power, Discipline and Superiority. His students are strikingly willing to follow him. Soon the entire school is under the spell of 'The Wave'. Anyone who refuses to be a part of the Movement, faces threats or worse. Ross himself gets carried away by his own experiment. Or has it turned into something more than an experiment? A climax is unavoidable, resulting in a hard lesson for both Ross and his students...\nPurpose being, do not be so easily misled or trusting in fellow men.  Deceit is abundant for those so included to be manipulated.\n\n\nUS Foreign Policy Secret Wars of the CIA:\nThe history of the terrorism conducted by the CIA, since the end of the World War II when countries in Asia and Latin America, were trying to make changes to improve their economical and political situation, the Unite States of North America realized that it was not good for their status as new super power; and began a new campaign, with only one rule, Anything Goes. This is the story of the terrorism of the CIA.\n\n\nAldous Huxley's 1962 Speech at UC Berkeley - The Ultimate Revolution:\nIt's important to note that Huxley was part of the elite's New World Order crowd and in 1962 he discusses the present and upcoming upheavals as part of the NWO agenda to establish global dominance.  Does any of this sound familiar?\n\n&quot;...Within the next generation I believe that the world's leaders will discover that infant conditioning and narco-hypnosis are more efficient, as instruments of government, than clubs and prisons, and that the lust for power can be just as completely satisfied by suggesting people into loving their servitude as by flogging them and kicking them into obedience. In other words, I feel that the nightmare of Nineteen Eighty-Four is destined to modulate into the nightmare of a world having more resemblance to that which I imagined in Brave New World.&quot; --From a letter to George Orwell, dated 21 October 1949; from Letters of Aldous Huxley, ed. Grover Smith; Harper &amp; Row, 1969.\n\n\n\n Jesus Appears - coming 7-4-11.  Your Independence Day.[/size]\n\n\nThis is dedicated to my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.\n\n\nThe Entire Collection can be found here: \n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe That The Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed..\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...\n\nMay Yahweh Bless You as He has me. Seed Long and Prosper from the Blessings of our Lord. I have asked the Father to Bless all those that Seed Long.  \n\nDo Not believe anything you find here, search the Scriptures daily to determine the tRUtH.    \n\n\nGet info on the Take Over by The New World Order Below\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.khouse.org/topical_bible_study&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.khouse.org/topical_bible_study&lt;/a&gt;                                                         Free online Bible Study &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.babylonthegreatisfalling.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.babylonthegreatisfalling.net&lt;/a&gt;                                                                End Times Prophecy - Who is Babylon the Great &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.hickoryhammockbaptist.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.hickoryhammockbaptist.org&lt;/a&gt;                                                                Pastueur Carl Gallops\n                                                                                       Listen to Alex Jones   Secular Truth &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.overcomers.ca&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.overcomers.ca&lt;/a&gt;                                                                                     Current Bible Prophecy &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theberean.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theberean.org/&lt;/a&gt;                                                                                    Daily Bible Study in Your Email &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.khouseafrica.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.khouseafrica.com/&lt;/a&gt;                                                                               Chuck Missler - Africa &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.store.khouse.org/store/catalog&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.store.khouse.org/store/catalog&lt;/a&gt;                                                          Chuck Missler - USA\n                                       Dehydrated Survival Food -  Excellent Taste &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://store.khouse.org/store/catalog/help/pacific_rim.html?it=C3sphAod&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://store.khouse.org/store/catalog/help/pacific_rim.html?it=C3sphAod&lt;/a&gt;       Chuck Missler - New Zealand, Australia, Pacific Rim\n \nSeed long and Prosper with Blessings from our Father.
