But don't quote me on that.)\n637MB\n720x304\nStereo 48k 96kb\n\n7.0/10 on IMDB\n\nSynopsis - Near the end of World War II, 14-year-old Michiel becomes involved with the Resistance \nafter coming to the aid of a wounded British soldier. With the conflict coming to an end, \nMichiel comes of age and learns of the stark difference between adventure fantasy \nand the ugly realities of war.\n\nThe only source I could find for this movie was an over compressed BBRip. I manaaged\nto clean it up and make it a cinematic 480p. I made this out of necessity. It's a really good movie, \nand I wanted it in my collection. I figured I can't be the only person out there that hates how the \nSRT files don't get picked up when streaming through your home.\n\nPlease seed.
