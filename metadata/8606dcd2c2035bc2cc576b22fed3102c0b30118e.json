Ten years later, the story starts with Igarashi Ganta, a seemingly ordinary, unassuming middle school student attending Nagano Prefecture's middle school. An escapee, a survivor of the great earthquake, Ganta has no memories of the tragedy and has lived a simple, normal life. This all changes one day when a strange man covered in blood and crimson armour appears, floating, out of his classroom windows. Smirking madly, this Red Man massacres Ganta's entire class and, instead of killing him, embeds a red crystal shard in his chest. Within days of the massacre, Ganta is declared the sole suspect and, following a suspiciously quick trial, is sentenced to death and imprisoned in Deadman Wonderland, a massive theme-park-like prison.\n\n***Video***\nH.264/AVC - 720x480p - 23.976FPS\n\n***Audio***\nAAC - English: 5.1ch\nAAC - Japanese: Stereo\n\n***Subtitles***\nEnglish (Official Subtitles)\n\n***Extras***\nJapanese Commercial\nU.S. Trailer\nU.S. Video Commentary\nClean OP (Uncensored)\nClean ED\n\n&quot;I'm Back!&quot;\nAll My Rips are encoded from DVD/BD with Official Subtitles unless no other choice.\nRequests are open.\nPlease seed 1:1 so other can enjoy this release","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8606dcd2c2035bc2cc576b22fed3102c0b30118e","amp;dn":"%5BCBM%5D+Deadman+Wonderland+1-12%2BOVA+Complete+%28Dual+Audio%29-%5BDVDRip-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8606dcd2c2035bc2cc576b22fed3102c0b30118e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,6,220,210,194,3,91,194,204,87,107,34,254,211,16,44,11,48,17,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
