The story of McCrae's Battalion has been told in the book of the same name by Jack Alexander. Now, the tale is retold as a TV documentary, Supreme Sacrifice.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ec79b1ee34216554663ea9d3745ef5ab49fefac","amp;dn":"Supreme+Sacrifice","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ec79b1ee34216554663ea9d3745ef5ab49fefac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,199,155,30,227,66,22,85,70,99,234,157,55,69,239,90,180,159,239,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
