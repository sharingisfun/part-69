That says enough about his reputation for percussive skills: broad,\nexpressive, functional, subtle. You get that on this album. And he's as good as\na composer/leader. Not only did he assemble this odd band with two bassists\n(Jonas Westergaard en Robert Landfermann) and two reed players (Tobias Delius\nand Wanja Slavin), with the great Joachim KÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼hn joining on piano on a few tracks,\nbut the music he creates with them fits within a category on its own. It is\ngentle, warm, lyrical, full of character and utterly creative. It's charming and\nwelcoming, soft and free-spirited at the same time. There are no exuberant\nemotional outbursts, no iconoclastic destruction, it's all subdued and elegant,\nwithout being sentimental. Most pieces have a clear composed often abstract\ntheme and structure, except for the three tracks called &quot;Grund&quot;, which sound\nlike pure tonal improvisations. Describing the music is impossible, as difficult\nas finding something to compare it with. I have listened to the album for more\nthan a month now, putting it on time and again, yet I postponed writing about\nbecause I lacked words. So there you are. Great album. Nothing more to say. A\nguy to follow.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48c0330174b19a4a14ae004b7cd32958a51a3d87","amp;dn":"Christian+Lillingers+Grund+-+First+Reason+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48c0330174b19a4a14ae004b7cd32958a51a3d87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,192,51,1,116,177,154,74,20,174,0,75,124,211,41,88,165,26,61,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
