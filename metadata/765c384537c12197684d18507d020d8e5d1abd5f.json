Because the Framerate differs from the English dub from a VHS source and the video pulled ripped from Laserdisc, it needed manual readjustments to match timelines. If there are any further problems with this version, they will be rectified in another revision\n\nFilename-- New Source Revision 1\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:765c384537c12197684d18507d020d8e5d1abd5f","amp;dn":"Guyver_OutofControl_EngDub_Revision1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"765c384537c12197684d18507d020d8e5d1abd5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,92,56,69,55,193,33,151,104,77,24,80,125,2,13,142,93,26,189,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
