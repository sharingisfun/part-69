Charles Anderson, a talented young reporter, feels trapped working for his deceased father's weekly newspaper and living in a tiny town (Dayton, TN) in steep decline. Seeing the &quot;Monkey Trial&quot; as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to break into the journalistic big leagues, Charles manages to insert himself into the middle of the &quot;Trial of the Century.&quot; Once in the midst of this staged event, however, he is torn between his love for the more principled Rose, his fiancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e, and the escalating moral compromises that he is asked to make as the eager protÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©gÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© of H.L. Mencken, America's most colorful and influential columnist.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68f42aa8777d04bbdc4ade8ec71f5f9a32bfff9b","amp;dn":"Alleged.2010.REPACK.BDRip.XviD-ESPiSE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68f42aa8777d04bbdc4ade8ec71f5f9a32bfff9b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,244,42,168,119,125,4,187,220,74,222,142,199,31,95,154,50,191,255,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
