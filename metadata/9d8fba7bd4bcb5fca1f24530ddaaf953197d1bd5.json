This just one of the many challenges that face the young hero Perseus, son of the mighty ruler of Olympus, Zeus. When Perseus was an infant, he and his mother were cast into the sea in a casket. Luckily, Perseus was rescued by a humble fisherman who raised him well.\nWhile his life may have appeared destined for mediocrity, the hero in him could not remain hidden as he embarked on a quest in which he needed to slay none other than the terrible Medusa, who could turn any man who looked at her into stone. But this would not be an easy task. He needed weapons, training, guidence, and much more.
