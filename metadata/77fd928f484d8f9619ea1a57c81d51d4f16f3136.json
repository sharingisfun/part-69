Together they roister and rankle in a house that begins as a roof over their heads and becomes a home for their hearts.  'Imagine Neighbours' being taken over by the writing team of John Steinbeck and Gabriel Garcia Marquez and you'll be close to the heart of Winton's impressive 'tale'. Tim Winton is just one of the 'best' independent Australian authors.\n\nGreat read enjoy.... don't forget to seed ........","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77fd928f484d8f9619ea1a57c81d51d4f16f3136","amp;dn":"Tim+Winton+-+Cloudstreet","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77fd928f484d8f9619ea1a57c81d51d4f16f3136","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,253,146,143,72,77,143,150,25,234,26,87,200,29,81,212,241,111,49,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
