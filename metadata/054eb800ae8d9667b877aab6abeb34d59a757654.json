From that day on, Amane ages no more. Amane learns of another with a similar oni-one that requires its host to kill-which leads Amane to the realization that the 'other' is the man who murdered his sister years ago. But when his decades-long quest for the murderer causes him to cross paths with a maniacal serial killer intent on murdering the woman Amane loves, the only one who can help him is the man who killed his sister.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:054eb800ae8d9667b877aab6abeb34d59a757654","amp;dn":"The+Immortal+-+Demon+In+The+Blood+%231-4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"054eb800ae8d9667b877aab6abeb34d59a757654","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,78,184,0,174,141,150,103,184,119,170,182,171,235,52,213,154,117,118,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
