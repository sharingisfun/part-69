There is\n                   some dialog loss from the commentators but who really gives a shit what they're\n                   saying most of the time anyway, right?  There is no loss of game play which is\n                   most important.  We waited 4 days hoping someone else would pre from a clean cap\n                   but it doesn't look like that's going to happen.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd131f44dc85746310b5adacdf004b4db1050b55","amp;dn":"NFL.2011.11.0ts.vs.Bills.READNFO.720p.HDTV.x264-MOMENTUM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd131f44dc85746310b5adacdf004b4db1050b55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,19,31,68,220,133,116,99,16,181,173,172,223,0,75,77,177,5,11,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
