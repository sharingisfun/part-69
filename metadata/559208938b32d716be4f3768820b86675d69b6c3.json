There the word &quot;Freshman&quot; is banned as sexist (&quot;First Year&quot;, freshman are now called). It's a violation of the school's speech code to &quot;explicitly or implicitly ask for sex&quot; (So how does a student get there...).\n\nHadley Heath, a UNC graduate, says that debate on campus is stifled and if you're not a liberal... better keep to yourself.\n\nDerek Spicer thought that his school- North Carolina State University- engaged in censorship in the name of &quot;civility.&quot; He reached out to the people at FIRE, like Robert Shibley, for help to protect the students' First Amendment rights.\n\nSteve Cooksey had a nutrition advice blog. The state government threatened to put him in jail for giving personal advice without a license. Paul Sherman of The Institute for Justice, challenges government's many licensing rules.\n\nStuart Campbell from Equality North Carolina, and Tami Fitzgerald from North Carolina Values Coalition, debate gay marriage. I'll bring up plural marriage.\n\nBuck Goldstein, author of Engines of Innovations, argues that big universities miss entrepreneurial thinking.\n\nWhat do the students think about free speech, free minds, and free people? Many were wise. We'll hear from them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:559208938b32d716be4f3768820b86675d69b6c3","amp;dn":"20120927-Stossel-%5BStossel+Goes+to+College%5D.Fox+Business.CF.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"559208938b32d716be4f3768820b86675d69b6c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,146,8,147,139,50,215,22,190,79,55,104,130,11,134,103,93,105,182,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
