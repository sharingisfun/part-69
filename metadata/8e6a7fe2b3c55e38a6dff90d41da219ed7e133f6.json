Upon review, Mega Mario looks and functions just like the original old school Super Mario Brothers. However it utilizes more levels, better graphics and can be played smoothly at a much higher resolution than the original game. Mega Mario worked well when launched and played directly from a portable USB Flash Drive.\n\n\nAuthors Website: http://megamario.de\n\nLicense: Open Source\n\nshout out to all the good open source projects like this","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e6a7fe2b3c55e38a6dff90d41da219ed7e133f6","amp;dn":"mega+mario","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e6a7fe2b3c55e38a6dff90d41da219ed7e133f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,106,127,226,179,197,94,56,166,223,249,13,65,218,33,158,215,225,51,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
