Based in part on Endgame, the best-selling book by Derrick Jensen, END:CIV asks: &quot;If your homeland was invaded by aliens who cut down the forests, poisoned the water and air, and contaminated the food supply, would you resist?&quot; Backed by Jensen's narrative, the film calls on us to act as if we truly love this land. \n\n\nfilm trips along at a brisk pace, using music, archival footage, motion graphics, animation, slapstick and satire to deconstruct the global economic system, even as it implodes around us. END:CIV illustrates first-person stories of sacrifice and heroism with intense, emotionally-charged images that match Jensen's poetic and intuitive approach. Scenes shot in the back country provide interludes of breathtaking natural beauty alongside clearcut evidence of horrific but commonplace destruction. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHosted by: Derrick Jensen\n=========================\n\n\n\nProduced &amp; directed by: Franklin Lopez\n======================================\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................:    End Civ Resist Or Die\nYear.................:    2011\nGenre................:    Documentary \nVideo Length.........:    01:15:50\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........:    192 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........:    (AC3) \nLanguage.............:    English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.:    16/9  \n\nVideo Codec..........:    XviD \nVideo Resolution.....:    640x480\nVIdeo Bitrate........:    1328 kbit/s\n\n\nSubs.................:    External English\nFile Size:...........:    720 MB\nFPS..................:    25.000000\n\nChannel(s)...........:    2 channels\nRelease date.........:    2011\n\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1830585/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1830585/&lt;/a&gt;\n  \n  \n\n\n\nNote: External subtitles included.\n==================================\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit\\&quot; Suprbay Forum\\&quot; at \nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the \\&quot;nfo\\&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                           *** RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ***\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f78daf7c5a240aeff5e13839f6b8d36050ef4330","amp;dn":"End+Civ+Resist+Or+Die-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f78daf7c5a240aeff5e13839f6b8d36050ef4330","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,141,175,124,90,36,10,239,245,225,56,57,246,184,211,96,80,239,67,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
