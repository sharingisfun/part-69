You as the player must take the role of Ashley Simms, the protagonist of Twin Sector. Suddenly awakened by the stations security A.I. system O.S.C.A.R., you face the imminent ex-tinction of all other still sleeping survivors due to an unknown failure in the life sup-port system. According to O.S.C.A.R., you are the only person who was able to be woken and therefore the only individual capable of saving mankind. Within the next ten hours you will need to repair the broken main generator of the subterranean bunker system in order to reestablish the stationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s functionality. But there are yet un-known forces trying to prevent you from succeeding at all costs! \n\n\nXpadder, with Xbox360 &amp; PS3 profiles included.\n\nTested with both 32 &amp; 64 bit OS, No video or Audio has been re-encoded.\n\nPICS:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/eacfNAAeL&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/eacfNAAeL&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/fACFdaAeL&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/fACFdaAeL&lt;/a&gt;\n\n                                   ENJOY.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4048b04a4464656f4c8634922ce7bf85034c05b1","amp;dn":"Twin+Sector+%5BENG%5D+%2B+Xpadder","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4048b04a4464656f4c8634922ce7bf85034c05b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,72,176,74,68,100,101,111,76,134,52,146,44,231,191,133,3,76,5,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
