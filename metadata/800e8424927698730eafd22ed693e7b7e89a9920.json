These are available for free on the iTunes store, but I downloaded all of them and put them in this torrent to make it easier for others to get them. Let me know if there were any problems with the download. Files are in alphabetical order, not in order of iTunes playlist. Currently I don't have time to fix that.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:800e8424927698730eafd22ed693e7b7e89a9920","amp;dn":"MIT+Linear+Algebra+Examples+Scholar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"800e8424927698730eafd22ed693e7b7e89a9920","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,14,132,36,146,118,152,115,14,175,210,46,214,147,231,183,232,154,153,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
