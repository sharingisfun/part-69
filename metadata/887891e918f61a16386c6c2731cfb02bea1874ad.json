Everything is new to them - bicycles, cell phones, automatic doors. Each episode focuses on one general and how she learns to adapt to the modern world.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:887891e918f61a16386c6c2731cfb02bea1874ad","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+Sengoku+Collection+-+26+%5B720p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"887891e918f61a16386c6c2731cfb02bea1874ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,120,145,233,24,246,26,22,56,108,108,39,49,207,176,43,234,24,116,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
