Bosworth and John R. Holland\n\nThe Web has changed the game for your customersÃ¢â‚¬â€ and, therefore, for you. Now, CustomerCentric Selling, already recognized as one of the premier methodologies for managing the buyer-seller relationship, helps you level the playing field so you can reach clients when they are ready to buy and create a superior customer experience.\n\nYour business and its people need to be Ã¢â‚¬Å“CustomerCentricÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€willing and able to identify and serve customersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ needs in a world where competition waits just a mouse-click away. Traditional wisdom has long held that selling means convincing and persuading buyers. But todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s buyers no longer want or need to be sold in traditional ways.\n\nCustomerCentric Selling gives you mastery of the crucial eight aspects of communicating with todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clients to achieve optimal results:\n\n    Having conversations instead of making presentations\n    Asking relevant questions instead of offering opinions\n    Focusing on solutions and not only relationships\n    Targeting businesspeople instead of gravitating toward users\n    Relating product usage instead of relying on features\n    Competing to winÃ¢â‚¬â€not just to stay busy\n    Closing on the buyerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s timeline (instead of yours)\n    Empowering buyers instead of trying to Ã¢â‚¬Å“sellÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ them\n\nWhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more, CustomerCentric Selling teaches and reinforces key tactics that will make the most of your organizationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s resources. Perhaps you feel you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have the smartest internal systems in place to ensure an ideal workflow. (Perhaps, as is all too common, you lack identifiable systems almost entirely.) From the basicsÃ¢â‚¬â€and beyondÃ¢â‚¬â€of strategic budgeting and negotiation to assessing and developing the skills of your sales force, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how to make sure that each step your business takes is the right one.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3c4af003fa1b304a24ba519d6da24d398acdcb1","amp;dn":"Customer+Centric+Selling+%28PDF%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3c4af003fa1b304a24ba519d6da24d398acdcb1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,196,175,0,63,161,179,4,162,75,165,25,214,218,36,211,152,172,220,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
