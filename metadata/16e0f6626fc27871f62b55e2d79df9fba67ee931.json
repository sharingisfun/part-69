The film is directed by Tim Burton and stars Johnny Depp as Barnabas Collins, a 200-year-old vampire who has been imprisoned in a coffin. Collins is eventually unearthed and makes his way back to his mansion, now inhabited by his dysfunctional descendants. Collins also discovers that his jealous ex-lover, Angelique Bouchard, played by Eva Green, has taken over the town's fishing business that was once run by the Collins family (Bouchard is a witch who was responsible for transforming Collins into a vampire). Michelle Pfeiffer also stars as Collins' cousin, Elizabeth Collins Stoddard, the reclusive matriarch of the Collins family","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16e0f6626fc27871f62b55e2d79df9fba67ee931","amp;dn":"Dark+Shadows+2012.+Blue+Ray+.x264.+yasirkajak+%2B+subtitles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16e0f6626fc27871f62b55e2d79df9fba67ee931","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,224,246,98,111,194,120,113,246,43,85,226,215,157,249,251,166,126,233,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
