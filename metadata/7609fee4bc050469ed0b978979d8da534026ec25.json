The pilot episode was viewable on Hulu and NBC.com,[4] prior to the series' broadcast premiere.\n\nRevolution takes place in a post-apocalyptic future. Fifteen years earlier, an unknown phenomenon disabled all advanced technology on the planet, ranging from computers and electronics to car engines, jet engines, and batteries. People were forced to adapt to a world without technology, and due to the collapse of public order, many areas are ruled by warlords and militias. The series focuses on the Matheson family, who possess an item that is the key to not only finding out what happened fifteen years ago, but also a possible way to reverse its effects. However, they must elude various enemy groups who want to possess that power for themselves.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7609fee4bc050469ed0b978979d8da534026ec25","amp;dn":"Revolution.S01E05.720p.HDTV.+%28Optimised+for+PS3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7609fee4bc050469ed0b978979d8da534026ec25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,9,254,228,188,5,4,105,237,11,151,137,121,216,218,83,64,38,236,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
