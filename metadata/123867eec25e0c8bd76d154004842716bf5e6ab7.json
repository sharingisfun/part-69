Though the San Jose-bred fivesome had no trouble igniting the local scene since forming in 2008, including dates alongside Flyleaf, Sublime, Deftones, Silversun Pickups and The Wedding, a pair of charting singles (Ã¢â‚¬Å“YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re A FakeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“The ElevatorÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), plus additional acclaim from Alternative Press, AOLÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Spinner.com and San FranciscoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s LIVE105 radio station, much of the catalyst behind the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s label debut Kings stems from front man Austin LyonsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ fractured upbringing. I Am Empire blends a passionate Rock vibe with a balance of hooks that will be ringing through your head for years.\n\n\n\nArtist: I Am Empire\nAlbum: Kings\nRelease Date: January 25th, 2011\nStyle: Rock / Alternative / Progressive\nLabel: Tooth &amp; Nail Records\nLocation: San Jose, CA\n\nQuality: 320 KBPS\n\nTracks:\n\n   1.
