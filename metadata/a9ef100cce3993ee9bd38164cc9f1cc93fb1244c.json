Music is his life. Having inherited the talent and passion for music from his deceased father, he wants to make sure that he doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t inherit one thing from his father ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ failure. So when he arrives in the City of Dreams, Mumbai, to make it big in the music field he pushes himself to his maximum limit ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and more ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ to make his dream come true. Starting as a DJ in his uncleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s (Yatin Karyekar) night club Tango Charlie, owned by Charlie (Mohan Kapoor), he soon finds himself expanding his avenues to establishing his own studio, making his own music and finally composing the same for a movie by Anurag Kashyap. But along with virtues come vices, so Ronak finds himself falling deeper into the world of alcohol, smoking and drugs as he gets into a relationship with Shonali (Mrinalini Sharma). Trouble starts when Ronak wakes up one day to realise that thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a constant ringing sound in his ears which makes normal hearing difficult. Initially dismissing it as a temporary problem, his work schedule goes for a toss when the problem persists. Visits to doctor reveal that he has tinnitus, inherited from his father and aggravated by his bad lifestyle. Eventually a freak accident renders him totally deaf which pushes him into a deep state of depression. Things change when Raunak meets Gauri (Soha Ali Khan), who too is hearing impaired but has mastered the art of lip-reading. In Gauri, Raunak finds a tutor and life-partner. Also his passion for music is rekindled, as he attempts to sense sound (if not hear) and study digital waveforms of tunes he knew, to create new music. Thereby a deaf DJ turns a renowned composer.\n\n::Trackers::\nCode: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://exodus.desync.com:6969/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://exodus.desync.com:6969/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://solotorrents.com/announce.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://solotorrents.com/announce.php&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://pow7.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://pow7.com/announce&lt;/a&gt;\nudp://tracker.1337x.org:80/announce &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://t1.pow7.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://t1.pow7.com/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.istole.it/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.istole.it/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n\nInfo Hash:A9EF100CCE3993EE9BD38164CC9F1CC93FB1244C \n\n::Screen Shots::\n[img]http://img443.imageshack.us/img443/1066/54302633wu.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://img810.imageshack.us/img810/1432/23308229.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://img694.imageshack.us/img694/8505/81300460.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://img72.imageshack.us/img72/2700/74852268.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://img834.imageshack.us/img834/7901/50399785.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://img337.imageshack.us/img337/6337/81388423.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://img219.imageshack.us/img219/1707/69959623.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://img403.imageshack.us/img403/5022/91555478.png[/img]\n\nwe are on FaceBook, Post Your Request, suggestion, and find upcomming Release of Silver RG, you will find all Silver RG Encoders at FB Page so keep in touch\nSearch Silver Release Group at FB\n\n\n::Greetz::\nTo All Silver RG Encoders,AliBaloch,Emad,TrT/TcT,Torrentstate,DarkNight,MXMG,BigW &amp; All Other P2P RGs\n\n::Note::\nMake sure its real Silver RG Release From Silvertorrents.me,A video sample is included in the folder for those who want to check quality and compatibility before downloading the whole movie.\n\n::Support::\nTook 5 Hours to Encode &amp; 24 Hours to Upload &amp; Seed\nTook 30 Minutes to Create Description/Screen Shots etc...\nTakes 1 Seconds to click on Quality,10 Seconds to say &quot;Thank You&quot;, or 4 seconds to say &quot;Whoooo&quot; ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9ef100cce3993ee9bd38164cc9f1cc93fb1244c","amp;dn":"Soundtrack+2011+Hindi+480p+DVDRip+x264+Ali+Baloch+Silver+RG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9ef100cce3993ee9bd38164cc9f1cc93fb1244c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,239,16,12,206,57,147,238,155,211,129,100,204,159,28,201,63,177,36,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
