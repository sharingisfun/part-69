Bush in this Oliver Stone biopic that traces the head of state's rise to power from a privileged alcoholic to a born-again Christian whose belief in religious destiny helped move him to the top ranks of political power.

Weiser, Bush is produced by fellow Stone collaborators Moritz Borman and Jon Kilik, with Elizabeth Banks co-starring as the first lady, James Cromwell as the elder President Bush, Ellen Burstyn as Barbara Bush and Richard Dreyfuss as Vice President Dick Cheney. \n\nRipped with Handbrake.\n\nLength: 2 Hours 9 Minutes\n\nFile Type: MP4\n\nFrame Width: 624\n\nFrame Height: 352\n\nFrame Rate: 29fps\n\nAudio\n\nBit Rate: 159kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c648dc7516bc2fb3b0ed251f8000801ecae8cfad","amp;dn":"W%282008%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c648dc7516bc2fb3b0ed251f8000801ecae8cfad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,72,220,117,22,188,47,179,176,237,37,31,128,0,128,30,202,232,207,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
