Also includes special behind the scenes footage.o\n\n  If anyone has any issues playing this on their ipod touch, or ipad, let me know so I can make tweaks to future rips. This was originally ripped for the Ipod Touch, but it will work on all ipads, and SHOULD work on iphones as well.\n\n\nPLEASE SEED AS LONG AS POSSIBLE! It will take the bandwith load off me and allow me to post more ipad/ipod ready dvd rips for everyone to enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a7ce112cf169df78b5aafbc638a2e6c00ff3903","amp;dn":"Band+of+Brothers+Part+5++%28H264%29+Ipod+%2B+IPAD.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a7ce112cf169df78b5aafbc638a2e6c00ff3903","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,124,225,18,207,22,157,247,139,90,175,188,99,138,46,108,0,255,57,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
