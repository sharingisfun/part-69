The Saints are kings of Stilwater, but their celebrity status has not gone unnoticed. The Syndicate, a legendary criminal fraternity with pawns in play all over the globe, has turned its eye on the Saints and demands tribute.\n\nRefusing to kneel to the Syndicate, you take the fight to Steelport, a once-proud metropolis reduced to a struggling city of sin under Syndicate control. Take a tank skydiving, call in a satellite-targeted airstrike on a Mexican wrestling gang, and defend yourself against a highly-trained military force using only a sex toy in the most outlandish gameplay scenarios ever seen, igniting a city-wide war that will set Steelport on fire.\n\nSaints Row: The Third gives you control of the Saints at the height of their power, and you live the life to show for it. Now Steelport is ripe for the taking, and it's up to you to make the city your own. Mold the skyline based on your choices, outfit your crew in classy gangster gear or furry costumes, and make life-or-death decisions that will change Steelport, and the Saints, forever. This is now your city. These are now your rules. Strap it on.\n\nSaints Row: The Third puts you on top of the world, right at the beginning of the game, with all the perks that go along with being the head of an elite criminal organization. There's no delivering pizza, no shuttling family members about in a long series of taxi missions. Instead, you take all the power of the Third Street Saints and you take the world by storm.\n\nOver the top: Like a lapdance from a porn star, the action is naughty, fun, and better than anything you're getting at home\n\nCity of sin: Disrupt and dismantle the Syndicate stranglehold on weapons, cybercrime, and sex trades. Discover the secrets of Steelport, where there is action on every street corner, for better or, more likely, worse.\n\nWeapons of crass destruction: It's one thing to defeat your enemies. It's another to humiliate them. Hover jets, human cannonball cars and sex-toy warfare are all part of the fun.\n\nCo-op madness: Give naked skydiving a try, landing in your partner's flaming pickup as you make a suicide run toward a heavily armed Syndicate brothel. Steelport is more fun with a friend.\n\nInitiation station: Create, share, and download the most outlandish characters every seen, from washed-up celebrities to naked ninja pirates. Inside every sinner, there is a Saint.\n\nTHIS IS A SCENE RELEASE, ALL CREDIT GOES TO THE ORIGINAL RIPPER!!!\n\nXGD3 Burn guide: http://nickthegr33k.eu/XGD3burn.pdf","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:050ac7dd0d588d9949c003a51d071c87e9668cb5","amp;dn":"SAINTS+ROW+THE+THIRD+-+SPARE+-+XBOX360+-+REGION+FREE+%7BBOOBSMAN%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"050ac7dd0d588d9949c003a51d071c87e9668cb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,10,199,221,13,88,141,153,73,192,3,165,29,7,28,135,233,102,140,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
