BusyBox is designed to be a small executable for use with the Linux kernel, which makes it ideal for use with embedded devices. It has been self-dubbed &quot;The Swiss Army Knife of Embedded Linux&quot;.\n\nThis version includes 1.20.0, 1.19.4, 1.19.3, 1.19.2, and 1.18.5 no need to have more than that because it takes up space on your phone and each newer version will still contain the older features, unless I forgot to compile them in.\n\nLeave this installed if you always want to get the latest version of busybox!\n\nWhat's in this version : (Updated : Sep 20, 2012)\n\n    Fixed null pointer exception\n    Added a check before install to test integrity of Binary being installed.\n\nRequired Android O/S : 1.6+ ROOT\n\n\n\n                                By bobiras2009\t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f49062ba91b53b9fd6a1fd8d970c2a3c0126065","amp;dn":"BusyBox+Pro+v9.6.2+Final+By+bobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f49062ba91b53b9fd6a1fd8d970c2a3c0126065","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,73,6,43,169,27,83,185,253,106,31,216,217,112,194,163,192,18,96,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
