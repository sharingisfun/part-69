However, these have been ripped to multiple formats and standards. What I noticed is that there was both a shortage of the older films, and that many had not been ripped to the most basic and widely used format; Xvid AVI files. Many also had various other deficiencies, such as missing extras, no subtitles, low resolution, poor seeding, or comments from downloaders noting various technical problems.\n\nSo, I have endeavored to create new and clean, fresh rips, including all the extras and so forth. I am seeding each film (starting with the first BP winner, 1928s WINGS) individually, complete with full documentation and screenshots, and clearer labeling. A couple of the oldest films were swiped from existing torrents because a good commercial copy of the DVD is unavailable, but the rest are fresh rips IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve made using DVDFab. My technical standards was to try to keep each film to at least .15 pixels. Each film has two passes.\n\n\n1946 - THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES (Frederic March, Dana Andrews)\n\n1947 - GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT (Gregory Peck)\n\n1948 - HAMLET (Laurence Olivier)\n\n1949 - ALL THE KING'S MEN (Broderick Crawford)\n\n1950 - ALL ABOUT EVE (Bette Davis)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b425c86cb9d9036068e42493bf2c7a67604fa4be","amp;dn":"Best+Picture+Oscar+Winners+1946-1950","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b425c86cb9d9036068e42493bf2c7a67604fa4be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,37,200,108,185,217,3,96,104,228,36,147,191,44,122,103,96,79,164,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
