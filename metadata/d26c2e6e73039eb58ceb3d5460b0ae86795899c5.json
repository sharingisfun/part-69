During the ceremony, Murad Krasniqi (Ã…Â erbedÃ…Â¾ija), the employer of the men and father of Marko, a victim whom Bryan killed via electrocution, states that they will find Bryan to avenge the deaths of their loved ones.\n\nWhen arriving at Kim's home to take her on a driving lesson, Bryan learns that Kim is not there and has a new boyfriend from her mother Lenore (Janssen) who is currently having relationship problems with her husband. After her husband cancels their holiday to China, Bryan suggests that Kim and Lenore join him in Istanbul after he has finished some work he has agreed on. After being led to believe that they have not taken him up on the offer, Bryan is surprised to find that Kim and Lenore have indeed flown out to join him, using his friends to surprise him.\n\nLater, after lunch in the marketplace, Kim stays behind in an attempt to help her parents rekindle their relationship. While they are out, they are pursued by Murad's men and, despite Bryan's efforts, Lenore is captured, forcing Bryan to surrender. Before he does so, he calls Kim to explain the situation and tells her to hide. With advice from Bryan, she is able to evade the kidnappers.\n\nBryan wakes up with his hands tied to a pole in a dark room. Using a communications device that he had hidden in his socks before setting out that day, Bryan calls Kim, instructing her to go to the US Embassy and tell them what happened, but she begs for a chance to help him and Lenore, which he decides to give her. Under Bryan's guidance, she opens up his weaponry suitcase and throws a live grenade out the window. Bryan uses the time it takes for the sound of the explosion to deduce his location. He then has her take a gun and two more grenades and travel towards his location via the rooftops while he frees himself from his restraints. Bryan then sends steam up a chimney to pinpoint his location, and Kim drops the gun down the chimney, allowing Bryan to use it to kill the guards and escape the building, leaving Lenore behind while he rescues Kim, who is being chased.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...\n\n\n\n\n\n* GLOBE FILES 2012\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d26c2e6e73039eb58ceb3d5460b0ae86795899c5","amp;dn":"TAKEN+2+-+PORsub-DELUXE+-+GLOBE.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d26c2e6e73039eb58ceb3d5460b0ae86795899c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,108,46,110,115,3,158,181,140,235,61,84,96,176,174,134,121,88,153,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
