According to Computerbild 01/08 Password Depot was Ã¢â‚¬Å“the only password management software that made a good impression during the comprehensive security testÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nPassword Security:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Best protection of your data due to double encryption with Rijndael 256! Your password list is protected twice: with the master password and with an internal key.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Protection from keylogging (intercepting of keystrokes) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ All password fields are internally protected from keylogging.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Password Depot leaves no trace of your passwords in the RAM. So even an attempt by a hacker to use your computer and try to browse the cryptic memory dumps for passwords - a theoretical option - would be defeated.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Clipboard protection Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Password Depot automatically detects any active clipboard viewers and masks its changes to the keyboard; after performing auto-complete, all sensitive data is automatically cleared from the clipboard.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ The integrated password generator creates virtually uncrackable passwords: instead of passwords like &quot;sweetheart&quot; or &quot;John&quot;, which can both be cracked in a few minutes, you now use passwords like &quot;g/:1bmV5T$x_sb}8T4@CN?A:y:Cwe-k)mUpHiJu:0md7p@\n\nPassword Management:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Friendly and easy-to-use interface, similar to the Windows Explorer, that allows you to navigate the password lists.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Top bar window for faster and more efficient navigation. Now available in classic design or as application desktop toolbar\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Auto-complete action that allows you to automatically complete fields on a web page with user name and password.\n\nAdditional Features:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Custom fields: Create as many fields as you like in the database. That way you can adjust Password Depot to your personal needs.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Recognition of correct passwords: The program recognizes automatically the password that is used for a website and suggests it automatically!\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ New wizards: Add web passwords using the wizards. Or install Password Depot on a USB flash drive with the help of the wizards.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Perfect local security: you can use the lock function to restrict other user's access to your personal passwords.\n\nSupported OS:\n\nWindows 7/vista/xp\n\nHomepage: http://www.password-depot.com/\n\nInstallation Instructions:\n\n1.
