Instead of changing the pixels of the photo itself, DAP uses the input image only as a guide to paint the scene with many different brushes and guided by real-world artists inspired techniques.\n\n&quot;In a nutshell, Dynamic Auto-Painter not only emulates the technique but also the way different painters would see the same scene&quot;\n\nSystem Requirments:\n\nMicrosoftÃ‚Â® WindowsÃ‚Â® 7, Vista or XP (32-bit or 64-bit editions)\n1 GHz processor or better\n2 GB of RAM\n1 GB of free disk space\nMinimum screen resolution: 1024 x 768 (highly recommended higher resolution)\n\nHomepage: http://www.mediachance.com/dap/index.html\n\nInstallation Instructions:\n\n1.
