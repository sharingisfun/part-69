I won't let the two guys pictured enough talk, because it's time we hear from the &quot;others.&quot;\n\nI say: One of them would be a better president than Obama or Romney.\n-----\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5e7dd01d56a7867d09367e32fd7b20f00cf5e78","amp;dn":"20120913-Stossel-%5BParty+Crashers%5D.Fox+Business.CF.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5e7dd01d56a7867d09367e32fd7b20f00cf5e78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,231,221,1,213,106,120,103,208,147,103,227,47,215,178,15,0,207,94,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
