Also fully compatible with Apex Launcher, Nova Launcher &amp; others.\n\nThis theme contains 240+ icons &amp; counting! &amp; it also contains the 6 wallpapers seen in the screenshots.\n\nIN GO LAUNCHER, THESE ICONS LOOK BEST WHEN YOU SET THE ICON SIZE TO LARGE! (menu&gt;preferences&gt;visual settings&gt;icons&gt;icon size) They also look their best against dark backgrounds.\nI take icon requests so please feel free to email me or leave a comment suggesting which app icons you'd like to see themed &amp; I'll try to make it =)\n\nThis is NOT a standalone app, you need a launcher such as Go, Apex, Nova, etc that allow custom themes.\n\nInstallation\n1.

Find Neon Minimal in any of the launcher's theme settings, then apply.\n\nWhat's in this version:\nUpdated to 1.9 on [September 4th, 2012]\n- Added 8 requested icons.\n- Updated &amp; cleaned up some icons, &amp; fixed some that weren't showing up properly (Galaxy S3)\n- I also have matching Neon Minimal themes for Go SMS, Go Contacts &amp; Go Locker, check 'em out!\nAny theme issues with Jelly Bean? Email me &amp; I'll send you the latest version!\n\n\n\n                                By bobiras2009\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ab82c7c0735f585b828b1be1e3f46a014f22a5f","amp;dn":"Neon+Go+Launcher+Apex+Theme+v1.9+Final+By+bobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ab82c7c0735f585b828b1be1e3f46a014f22a5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,184,44,124,7,53,245,133,184,40,177,190,30,63,70,160,20,242,42,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
