Never interrupts your music.\nPause Music Mode:Ã¢â‚¬Â¨\n\n+Uses your headset's microphone to listen for loud noises and pause your music if one is detected, then play back the sound that triggered the pause and continues for a short period of time the optionally resumes your music.\n\nWhere would I use it?Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â¨\nAt the office: pause your music automatically when someone is trying to get your attention\nAt home: Don't miss door slams, children crying, your dog barking, or other warning signsÃ¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â¨\nAt the airport: Relax at the gate and have your music pause when the gate announcements startÃ¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â¨\nAnywhere relatively quiet where you want to know if something happens around you\n\nBest to use with:\n\n    Sound isolating earbud headphones with mic\n    These are practically earplugs now, so don't miss out on what's around you.Ã¢â‚¬Â¨\n    You can use it with just headphones but be aware the microphone used is now your phone. So leaving it in your pocket wouldn't work so well.\n\nWhat's in this version: (Updated : Aug 25, 2012)\n\n    Fixed Bug: Settings not saving on exit\n    NEW: Profiles (all settings + trigger level) - Pro or Pro Features Upgrade Required\n    NEW: Tasker support!
