You can find both .package and .Sim3Packs in seperate folders in the torrent.

If you do this right, everything is going to work. (see below)\n\n******WARNING!!*******\nIF YOU GOT FIXER_V3 OR 4 FROM MY PREVIOUS PACKS, YOU _MUST_ DELETE THIS FILE FROM YOUR OVERRIDES OR PACKAGES FOLDER **ccmerged_decrapped.package** !!!!!
