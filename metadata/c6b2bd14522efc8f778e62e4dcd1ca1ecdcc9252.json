You\\'ll start with a lousy vehicle, but it won\\'t be long before you\\'re able to snag a pink slip to a nicer ride. As you progress you\\'ll earn cash, which can be used to unlock (50+) new vehicles from manufacturers such as Nissan, Dodge, Cadillac, Ford, Porsche, Lamborghini, BMW, Aston Martin, Mitsubishi, and more. If you\\'re into tuning individual aspects of your ride or purchasing individual parts you can do that, but if you\\'re not into tinkering you can purchase an upgrade package and be on your way.
