The program stays out of way in system tray area, and waits for a movement at the front of the camera. Once movement is detected, SecurityCam starts either video recording or makes a snapshot of a picture. The program can optionally do some other functions like playback a warning sound.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc08e7457cd1262563e4409e9391169054bbd810","amp;dn":"SecurityCam+1.4.0.5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc08e7457cd1262563e4409e9391169054bbd810","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,8,231,69,124,209,38,37,99,228,64,158,147,145,22,144,84,187,216,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
