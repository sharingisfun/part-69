Rose contacts her husband Christopher (Sean Bean) in the real world through a mirror and manages to send Sharon to him using an amulet. Rose remains behind to distract the cult that wants Sharon. Sharon has no memory of the events in Silent Hill, and Christopher lies to her that her mother died in a car accident.\n\nYears later, a teenage Sharon (Adelaide Clemens) and her father live under the assumed identities of Heather and Harry Mason respectively. The pair are constantly relocating and altering their identity to hide from the cult. Heather suffers from recurring nightmares of herself in the Silent Hill amusement park where she is set on fire by the evil Alessa. During her journey to school, Heather is questioned about her identity by Douglas Cartland (Martin Donovan), a private investigator hired by the cult, but Heather avoids the situation. At school she meets Vincent (Kit Harrington), another student who she runs into after the school transforms into a nightmarish alternate reality. After school she again sees Douglas, and calls her father. After the call, Harry is abducted by an unseen force. Later, Heather waits at a mall for Harry when reality again shifts, unleashing monstrous creatures. After evading the monsters Heather encounters Douglas who is killed by a monster and dragged away. After returning to the real world, Heather finds Douglas' corpse and flees.\n\n\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...\n\n\n\n\n\n* GLOBE FILES 2012","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d2adb5ee83601b4387a1fcb8958ed142bb016dc","amp;dn":"Silent+Hill+Revelation+3D+2012+CamRip+RUS.flv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d2adb5ee83601b4387a1fcb8958ed142bb016dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,42,219,94,232,54,1,180,56,122,31,203,137,88,237,20,43,176,22,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
