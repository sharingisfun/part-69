Do not be misguided by stupidly chosen title.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed6f35273186b2ab6fdbddf085f3fc0cb2fe8cf8","amp;dn":"The.Devils.Whore.1-4.576p.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed6f35273186b2ab6fdbddf085f3fc0cb2fe8cf8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,111,53,39,49,134,178,171,111,219,221,240,133,243,252,12,178,254,140,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
