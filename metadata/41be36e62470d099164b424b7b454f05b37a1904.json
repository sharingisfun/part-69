The sons share the same father, a womanizing drunk, but all have different mothers. Their father died a rich man and when they're brought together by their sister Nina to learn which of them will inherit the old man's fortune, they are handed an unpleasant surprise. A requirement of the will is that the three estranged siblings go into business together as bail bondsmen. Their first job is to bring in a parole violator who has left Leo with a $250,000 debt. Their search will take them into the mountains of Mexico where they encounter a drug lord and uncover a kidnapping plot, masterminded by an embittered entrepreneur that will endanger them all.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1792543/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1792543/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41be36e62470d099164b424b7b454f05b37a1904","amp;dn":"The+Reunion+%282011%29IPOD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41be36e62470d099164b424b7b454f05b37a1904","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,190,54,230,36,112,208,153,22,75,66,75,123,69,79,5,179,122,25,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
