So you know, there are only pro-Christian titles in here, but they are all well-respected scholars in their fields of study.\n\nThey are difficult to locate online and I do not take credit for the majority of their availability. \n\nTPB member moman73 had a few in his torrents and generally is able to collect good resources from the opposite viewpoint. I do recommend going through his torrents for some solid gems.\n\n-----\n\nFlaming this torrent does not change the fact that I did not write these books. I am only making them available since it seemed the bulk of religious torrents were very negative in their depiction to Christian ideas. \n\nSo here's to speech equality!\n\n-----\n\nLong live spinach pie!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87c246f078a11c911d0ab0c3ea468065d0b07742","amp;dn":"Reformed+Theological+Scholarship","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87c246f078a11c911d0ab0c3ea468065d0b07742","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,194,70,240,120,161,28,145,29,10,176,195,234,70,128,101,208,176,119,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
