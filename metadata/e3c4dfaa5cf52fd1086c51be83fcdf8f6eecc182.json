Visit the scene of a crime so perfect that, for thirty years, no one knew it had even taken place. Investigate the birth of a criminal conspiracy to rob each and every bank vault in America.  The true, behind the scenes, story of the birth of the US Federal Reserve.\n\nThe Secret History, examines the conspiratorial nature in which the Fed was born, a meeting of the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most influential financiers that took place on Jekyll Island, Georgia in 1910. This film questions why the mainstream media donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t really delve into the problems stemming from the secretive role of the Federal Reserve and other powerful financial groups that meet clandestinely. This would be a meaningful debate to bring up in todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s environment. There is a credible element of intrigue conveyed throughout the film, depicting the ultimate crime to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œrob every bank vault in America all at the same time,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ leading to the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, that President Woodrow Wilson signed, but instantly regretted.\n\n\nMoney as Debt:\nPaul Grignon's animated presentation of &quot;Money as Debt&quot; tells in very simple and effective graphic terms what money is and how it is being created. It is an entertaining way to get the message out. The Cowichan Citizens Coalition and its &quot;Duncan Initiative&quot; received high praise from those who previewed it. I recommend it as a painless but hard-hitting educational tool and encourage the widest distribution and use by all groups concerned with the present unsustainable monetary system in Canada and the United States.\n\nMoney As Debt is a fast-paced and highly entertaining animated feature by artist &amp; videographer, Paul Grignon. It explains today's magically perverse DEBT-MONEY SYSTEM in terms that are easy to understand.\n\nCheck out his website: http://www.moneyasdebt.net/\n\nMoney is a new form of slavery, and distinguishable from the old simply by the fact that it is impersonal, there is no human relation between master and slave. Debt- government, corporate and household has reached astronomical proportions. Where does all this money come from? How could there BE that much money to lend? The answer is...there isn't. Today, MONEY IS DEBT. If there were NO DEBT there would be NO MONEY.  If this is puzzling to you, you are not alone. Very few people understand, even though all of us are affected.\n\n\nThe Secret of Oz:\nThe Secret of Oz won best documentary of 2010 at the Beloit International Film Festival. It won the Silver Sierra Award for Excellence in Filmmaking at the Yosemite Film Festival. It won the Award of Merit at The Accolade Competition in La Jolla, California. It won the Silver Screen Award at the Nevada Film Festival. It's received an excellent review on Nathan's Economic Edge, one of the world's top economics blogs. It's British premier was at the prestigious Bromsgrove conference on Oct. 1. What's going on with the world's economy? Foreclosures are everywhere, unemployment is skyrocketing - and this may only be the beginning. Could it be that solutions to the world's economic problems could have been embedded in the most beloved children's story of all time, &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;? The yellow brick, the emerald city of Oz, even Dorothy's silver slippers (changed to ruby slippers for the movie version) were powerful symbols of author L. Frank Baum's belief that the people - not the big banks -- should control the quantity of a nation's money. The bottom line: No More National Debt. All our money is created out of debt. But nations don't have to borrow money from banks. Sovereign nations can create their own money -- debt free -- just as Abraham Lincoln did.\n\nWhat's the Movie About?\n\nIt is well known in economics academia that The Wonderful Wizard of Oz written by L. Frank Baum in 1900 is loaded with powerful symbols of monetary reform which were the core of the Populist movement and the 1896 and 1900 president bid of Democrat William Jennings Bryan.\n\nThe yellow brick road (gold standard), the emerald city of Oz (greenback money), even Dorothy's silver slippers (changed to ruby slippers for the movie version) were the symbol of Baum's and Bryan's belief that adding silver coinage to gold would provide much needed money to a depression-strapped, 1890s America.\n\nWe believe Baum's symbols represent the only solution to relieve the growing economic hardship here in America -- and the rest of the world. Practically speaking, 2009 marks the 70th anniversary of the 1939 MGM release of the The Wizard of Oz movie, so interest will be very high. Even Oz websites put up by kids get millions of hits.\n\nWho's In It?\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Joseph Farah, Founder and CEO of WorldNetDaily.\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Peter Schiff, President of Euro-Pacific Capital, the leading &quot;bear&quot; on Wall Street, author.\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Byron Dale, author and monetary reform expert, author of many books.\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Ellen Brown, author Web of Debt, attorney, and monetary reform expert\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· James Robertson, former official in a variety of slots in the UK government, and head of the Inter-Bank Research Organization, author of many books\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Prof. Nick Tideman, VA Tech University School of Economics\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Prof. Michael Hudson, President of The Institute for the Study of Long-Term Economic Trends (ISLET), a Wall Street Financial Analyst, Distinguished Research Professor of Economics at the University of Missouri, Kansas City and author of Super-Imperialism: The Economic Strategy of American Empire (1972 and 2003)\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· John Keyworth, Curator, Bank of England Museum\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Prof. Quentin Taylor, professor of political science at Rogers State University\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Reed Simpson, banker, asset manager\n\n\nIntro\n\n&quot;In 1996, in a documentary called &quot;The MoneyMasters&quot;, we asked the question why is America going broke. It wasn't clear then that we were, but it is today. Now the question is how can we get out of this mess. Foreclosures are everywhere, unemployment is skyrocketing -- and this is only the beginning. America's economy is on a long, slippery slope from here on. The bubble ride of debt has come to an end.\n\n&quot;What can government do? The sad answer is -- under the current monetary system -- nothing. It's not going to get better until the root of the problem is understood and addressed. There isn't enough stimulus money in the entire world to get us out of this hole.\n\n&quot;Why? Debt. The national debt is just like our consumer debt -- it's the interest that's killing us.\n\n&quot;Though most people don't realize it the government can't just issue it's own money anymore. It used to be that way. The King could just issue stuff called money. Abraham Lincoln did it to win the Civil War.\n\n&quot;No, today, in our crazy money system, the government has to borrow our money into existence and then pay interest on it. That's why they call it the National Debt. All our money is created out of debt. Politicians who focus on reducing the National Debt as an answer probably don't know what the National Debt really is. To reduce the National Debt would be to reduce our money -- and there's already too little of that.\n\n&quot;No, you have to go deeper. You have to get at the root of this problem or we're never going to fix this. The solution isn't new or radical. America used to do it. Politicians used to fight with big bankers over it. It's all in our history -- now sadly -- in the distant past.\n\n&quot;But why can't we just do it again? Why can't we just issue our own money, debt free? That, my friends, is the answer. Talk about reform! That's the only reform that will make a huge difference to everyone's life -- even worldwide.\n\n&quot;The solution is the secret that's been hidden from us for just over 100 years -- ever since the time when author L. Frank Baum wrote &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.&quot;\n\nLegal Problems and battles in Court:\nIf anyone wants to learn more about the Legal aspects and ramifications in a court of law, POtHS offers a torrent for download to assist others in the dilemna.
