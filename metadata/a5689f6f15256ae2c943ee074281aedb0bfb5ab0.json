What Church of Jesus breaks all ten commandments then tell you that THEY (POPE)can forgive you of your Sins. Worship The Image of Mother Mary? NOT ME. For me it is The Father Yahweh, The Son Jesus and of Course my friends The Holy Spirit that I Pray in the Name of. It's The Trinity of Course!!!\n\n\nDescription:\n\nDevil in The Vatican\n\nSigns of the Times\nSIN-ister Clips\nThe Holy Spirit\n\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5689f6f15256ae2c943ee074281aedb0bfb5ab0","amp;dn":"POTHS+3+-+Satan+-+11+-+In+The+Vatican+-+Part+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5689f6f15256ae2c943ee074281aedb0bfb5ab0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,104,159,111,21,37,106,226,201,67,238,7,66,129,174,219,11,251,90,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
