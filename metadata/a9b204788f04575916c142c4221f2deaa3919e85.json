Garcia's head looks like a rugby ball.)\nMoody Blues - Ride My Seesaw\nPink Floyd  - \t3 color clips from French TV  (No Syd)\n\t\tJugband Blues (Syd's swan song)\nRitchie Havens - High Flying Bird\nThe Shadows - FBI\nSonny and Cher - I Got You Babe\nStatus Quo - Pictures of Matchstick Men\nTim Buckley - Coming Home\nJimi Hendrix - 3 B&amp;W clips - Hey Joe, Purple Haze, Stone Free  (This stuff is loud, raw, and heavy - awesome!)\nLed Zeppelin - Dazed and Confused\n\nPlease seed this as long as possible to keep this historical record alive for future generations.\n\nCheck back in a week or two for a collection of 70's videos.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9b204788f04575916c142c4221f2deaa3919e85","amp;dn":"1960%27s+music+video+collection+%28part+2%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9b204788f04575916c142c4221f2deaa3919e85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,178,4,120,143,4,87,89,22,193,66,196,34,31,45,234,163,145,158,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
