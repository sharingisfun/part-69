Who cares what it is called. Call it Socialism, Call it Real Democracy Now, and Call it Chunky-Monkey-Cherry Garcia. The world needs to change radically, it needs to change dramatically, and it needs to change fast. This documentary is an invitation for you to participate in that positive change. Frankly, because, we need you. Yes, you.\nGenre: Documentary\nRelease date: 28/09/2012\n\n::General::\n-----------\nFormat: MPEG-4\nFile Size: 314 MiB\nOverall Bit Rate: 581 Kbps\nDuration: 1h 15mn\nSample: Included\nSubtitles: NO\n\n::Video Info::\n--------------\nContainer: avc1\nVideo Codec Type:\nVideo bitrate: 482 Kbps\nEncoding type: 2 Pass TURBO 1ST PASS\nResolution: 640 X 360 pixels\nAspect ratio(AR): 16:9\nQuality Factor(QF): 0.087\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\nSource: DVD.Thanks!!\n\n::Audio Info::\n--------------\nAudio Language:\nAudio Codec: AAC\nBitrate Mode: Variable\nBitrate: 96.0 Kbps\nSample Rate: 44.1 KHz\nChannel Count: 2 channels (Front: L R)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7e20f201fbdce38f9d80fe5a915fbf11bfde013","amp;dn":"American+Autumn+-+An+Occudoc+%5B2012%5D+Dennis+Trainor+Jr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7e20f201fbdce38f9d80fe5a915fbf11bfde013","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,226,15,32,31,189,206,56,249,216,15,229,169,21,251,241,27,253,224,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
