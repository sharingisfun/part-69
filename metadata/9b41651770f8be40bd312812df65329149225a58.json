It was produced by David O. Selznick and directed by Victor Fleming from a screenplay by Sidney Howard. Set in the 19th century American South, the film stars Clark Gable, Vivien Leigh, Leslie Howard, Olivia de Havilland, and Hattie McDaniel, among others, and tells a story of the American Civil War and Reconstruction era from a Southern point of view.\n\nThis tale of the Old South from the start of the Civil War through to the period of reconstruction focuses on the beautiful Scarlett O'Hara. Before the start of the war life at the O'Hara plantation, Tara, could only be described as genteel. As for the young Scarlett, she is without doubt the most beautiful girl in the area and is always the belle of the ball. She is very much looking forward to a barbecue at the nearby Wilkes plantation as she will get to see the man she loves, Ashley Wilkes. She is more than a little dismayed when she hears that he is to marry his cousin Melanie Hamilton and in a fit of anger, she decides to marry Melanie's brother. War is soon declared and as always seems to be the case, men march off to battle thinking that it will only last a few weeks. Now living in Atlanta, Scarlett sees the ravages that war brings. She also becomes re-acquainted with Rhett Butler, whom she had first met at the Wilkes barbecue. Now a widow, she still pines for the married Ashley and dreams of his return. With the war lost however, she returns to Tara and faces the hardship of keeping her family together and Tara from being sold at auction to collect the taxes. She has becomes hardened and bitter and will do anything, including marrying her sister's beau, to ensure she will never again be poor and hungry. After becoming a widow for the second time, she finally marries the dashing Rhett but they soon find themselves working at cross-purposes, their relationship seemingly doomed from the outset.\n\n\nThe film received 10 Academy Awards (8 competitive, 2 honorary), a record that stood for 20 years. Ben-Hur surpassed it in 1960. In the American Film Institute's inaugural Top 100 Best American Films of All Time list of 1998, it was ranked fourth, and in 1989 was selected to be preserved by the National Film Registry. The film was the longest American sound film made up to that time ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3 hours 44 minutes, plus a 15 minute intermission, and was among the first of the major films shot in color (Technicolor), winning the first Academy Award for Best Cinematography in the category for color films. It became the highest-grossing film of all-time shortly after its release, holding the position until 1966; after adjusting for inflation, it has still earned more than any other film in theater rentals.\n\n\nCast\n\nVivien Leigh as Scarlett O'Hara\nClark Gable as Rhett Butler\nLeslie Howard as Ashley Wilkes\nOlivia de Havilland as Melanie Hamilton\nThomas Mitchell as Gerald O'Hara\nBarbara O'Neil as Ellen O'Hara\nEvelyn Keyes as Suellen O'Hara\nAnn Rutherford as Carreen O'Hara\nGeorge Reeves as Stuart Tarleton*\nFred Crane as Brent Tarleton*\nHattie McDaniel as Mammy\nOscar Polk as Pork\nButterfly McQueen as Prissy\nVictor Jory as Jonas Wilkerson\nEverett Brown as Big Sam\nHoward Hickman as John Wilkes\nAlicia Rhett as India Wilkes\nRand Brooks as Charles Hamilton\nCarroll Nye as Frank Kennedy\nLaura Hope Crews as Aunt Pittypat\nEddie Anderson as Uncle Peter\nHarry Davenport as Dr. Meade\nLeona Roberts as Mrs. Meade\nJane Darwell as Mrs. Merriwether\nOna Munson as Belle Watling\nWard Bond as Tom, Yankee Captain\nCliff Edwards as voice of unseen Reminiscent Soldier\nCammie King as Bonnie Blue Butler\nEmily Eby as Grandma Moses\nPaul Hurst as Yankee deserter\nIsabel Jewell as Emmie Slattery\nYakima Canutt as Shantytown renegade\n\n(The credits in the film contain an error: George Reeves and Fred Crane appear as the Tarleton brothers.
