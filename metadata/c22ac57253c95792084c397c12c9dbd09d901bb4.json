It is based on the events taking place in the northern regions of Middle-earth in the background of the main story of J. R. R. Tolkien\\\\\\'s The Lord of the Rings, more specifically in Peter Jackson\\\\\\'s The Lord of the Rings film trilogy universe. Players take control of a hero of the war, and are able to play through the game alone or co-operatively with other players.\n\n\n[edit] Synopsis\n \n[edit] Locations\n \nMany locations that are not featured in the movies are in the game. Confirmed locations include the Ettenmoors, Fornost, Mirkwood and Mount Gundabad. Locations from the movies also appear in the game. Players can explore Bree and Rivendell and interact with the characters there which include Gandalf, Elrond, Frodo, Bilbo, Legolas, Arwen and Aragorn. Characters from the books can also be expected to appear in the game. Elrond\\\\\\'s twin sons, the Ranger Halbarad, and Radagast are confirmed.[8]\n \n[edit] Characters\n \nThe War in The North features three playable protagonists. Each character has different classes from one another but each character\\\\\\'s class is adaptable. For example, Eradan is a Ranger and thus excels with the bow and sword but lacks the strength of Farin. He can be leveled up however to be an expert with two handed weapons, dual wielding, weapons and shields (tank) or the bow. Farin is an expert with melee weapons but can use ranged weapons and can be leveled up to use such. He can also be leveled up to be the tank or the damage dealer of the party. Andriel is a mage but she can wield two swords at once and level up in melee attacks, supportive magic or offensive magic.[9]\n Eradan Eradan is the Ranger class, he is a DÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âºnadan. (From Elvish dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âºn-adan, meaning Man of the West, NÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âºmenorean.) He is the most adaptable playable character and is adept at using any weapon. He can use a two handed sword, a sword and shield, dual wield weapons or a bow. Eradan also has access to many stealth abilities which allow him to sneak up on enemies to attack them. Farin Farin is the Champion class, he hails from Erebor. He is best described as the warrior character but he can use a crossbow and simply focus on using it to attack enemies from afar. Out of all three characters, Farin is the most skilled in using melee weapons and he has many powerful abilities allowing him to attack multiple enemies at once. He can also mine for gems. Andriel Andriel is the Elven Loremaster class who has been taught by Elrond. She hails from Rivendell. She uses magic as her defense and offense but can dual wield a one handed weapon with her staff which she can also use to melee attack enemies with. Her abilities include offensive spells and supportive spells but she also has melee abilities and can be leveled up to be a \\\\\\&quot;battlemage\\\\\\&quot; if the player wishes. She also has the ability to create potions from alchemy ingredients that the player may find. \n[edit] Development\n \n\n\n[show]System requirements\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis section is empty.
