The series, created by Scott Silveri, was given a series order on April 20, 2012, and will air this preview episode following the Olympics coverage on August 8th. The series will officially premiere in its time slot on September 11, 2012, airing Tuesdays at 9:00 pm Eastern/8:00 pm Central after The Voice.\n\nWhen the going gets tough, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time to get laughing. Sports radio talk show host Ryan King (Matthew Perry) has just been through hell, so his plan? Get back to work and get on with his life. Unfortunately, his boss has another idea: join a support group before getting back on the air.\n\nNow, in the last place he ever thought heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d be, surrounded by an oddball cast of characters each with their own issues, the charming but cocky Ryan is in more trouble than ever. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s never been accused of being a team player. \n\nSo, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a big surprise when Ryan's lack of interest in everyoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sob stories Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and total dismissal in his own, proves to be just what this group needs to deal with their stuff. Could it be this eccentric bunch really will help him get on with his life? Now, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s funny. \n\nFrom Emmy-winning writer and executive producer Scott Silveri (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Perfect Couples,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“FriendsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) comes a new series about getting back on track by leaving your comfort zone.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d72007b1d1473eb2de80b27cf846db96a1c5a1b2","amp;dn":"Go.On.S01E06.720p.HDTV.MPEG2-SM10+%28Optimised+for+PS3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d72007b1d1473eb2de80b27cf846db96a1c5a1b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,32,7,177,209,71,62,178,222,128,178,124,248,70,219,150,161,197,161,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
