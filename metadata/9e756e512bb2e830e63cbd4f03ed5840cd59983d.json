Extinction Agenda v1.20 by VACE. I didn't find a good torrent of this game so I thought I upload it here. Unpack the rars, run the vace.bat then hit the ares.exe to play! There's a NFO file in the torrent. Avast didn't report any viruses and uploading a few small files to VirusTotal and only 2 hits, I think they were minor/weak threats.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e756e512bb2e830e63cbd4f03ed5840cd59983d","amp;dn":"A.R.E.S.Extinction.Agenda","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e756e512bb2e830e63cbd4f03ed5840cd59983d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,117,110,81,43,178,232,48,230,60,189,79,3,237,88,64,205,89,152,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
