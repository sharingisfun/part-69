LPS-Public comes preconfigured with a smart card-enabled Firefox web browser with Java and Flash support, Encryption Wizard-Public, a PDF viewer, a file browser, remote desktop software (Citrix, Microsoft or VMware View), SSH client, and the ability to use USB flash drives. This build does not contain any FOUO material or any customized software.\nLPS-Public Deluxe adds OpenOffice software, which is a Microsoft Office-compatible suite of office applications, and Adobe Reader, which allows PDF files to be digitally signed.\nA customized version of LPS, called LPS-Remote Access, is designed primarily for DoD and federal government agencies. It is available by request, and can be customized with additional applications, including VPN and Thin Client software. This allows users to connect directly to corporate or enterprise networks and function as part of the network. Each version of LPS-Remote Access is customized for a particular customer's network.\nAs our customers give us additional requirements, we evaluate whether to create a new edition of LPS or to incorporate the features into the roadmap of existing products. If you have specific requirements, we would like to hear from you. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.spi.dod.mil/liposeFeatures.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.spi.dod.mil/liposeFeatures.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLPS Release Notes\nChanges in Version 1.3.1\nMaintenance release, released 11 November 2011\n    * Updated Firefox to 8.0.0\n    * Updated Adobe Reader to 9.4.6\n    * Updated Flash to 11.1.102.55\n    * Added iPhone 4S tethering support\n    * Upgraded boot loader\n    * Added Java character map tool &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.spi.dod.mil/CHANGES.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.spi.dod.mil/CHANGES.html&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.spi.dod.mil/lipose.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.spi.dod.mil/lipose.htm&lt;/a&gt; (other version) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.spi.dod.mil/docs/Hashes.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.spi.dod.mil/docs/Hashes.pdf&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03652863f1419f2629edc43878b5c86327f0fdae","amp;dn":"LPS-1.3.1_public.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03652863f1419f2629edc43878b5c86327f0fdae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,101,40,99,241,65,159,38,41,237,196,56,120,181,200,99,39,240,253,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
