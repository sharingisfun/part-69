The Chameleon system includes an innovative context based home screen system giving you the most relevant information that you want, when you want it.\n\n\nThe Next Generation of Widgets.\n\nAndroid widgets are not all created equally - and that's the problem - so we decided to raise the bar. The result is widgets that look beautiful together and are as easy to layout as drawing on a screen. Take a look at some of our other widgets or build your own with our custom API.\n\n-Calendar\n-Clock\n-Facebook\n-Google+\n-Instagram\n-Media Player (Coming soon)\n-RSS News Reader\n-Switches\n-Twitter\n-YouTube\n\nHome Screens that Change With You\nYour information needs may change throughout your day, so Chameleon includes an innovative context system. You can create context rules based on GPS locations, WiFi networks and time ranges, allowing you to define which Home Screen is the most relevant for any situation.\n\nApp Tray &amp; Launcher\nChameleon doesn't just let you customize your Home Screens with the widgets you want. It also lets you customize your own mini App Tray. Giving you the apps you want up front, without having to swim through a large grid of apps.\n\nSuper Easy To Customize\nQuickly set up Home Screens, Widgets, App Trays, and Wallpapers all with a few gestures.\n\nChameleon. Always relevant. Immediately valuable.\n\nWhat's in this version:\nFixed the Ã¢â‚¬Å“blank widgetÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ problem. (For real this time [we think...]).\nDeactivated Dashboard Sleeping. (Needs a bit more work). They will appear as sleeping at startup, though.\n7Ã¢â‚¬Â³ Tablets can now have 5 Dashboards. 10Ã¢â‚¬Â³ are limited to 4.\n\n\n                                By bobiras2009\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9624b08c6e67d81a0585c2f969b92eb20ac3aa3","amp;dn":"Chameleon+Launcher+v1.0.0+Final+Cracked+By+bobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9624b08c6e67d81a0585c2f969b92eb20ac3aa3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,98,75,8,198,230,125,129,160,88,92,47,150,155,146,235,32,172,58,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
