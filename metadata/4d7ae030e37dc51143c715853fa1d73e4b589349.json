Fulham boss Martin Jol will have approached \nthis match with relish given he was manager of Tottenham for three years. Still a hugely popular figure \namong Spurs fans, the Dutchman will put sentiment to one side as he bids to end Fulham's dismal run \nin league fixtures between these sides. The Cottagers have only beaten Tottenham in one of their last \n10 league matches, but they triumphed easily against Harry Redknapp's side 4-0 in the FA Cup last season. \nThe other fixtures include struggling Bolton hosting Stoke at the Reebok Stadium and Wigan travelling to \nthe Midlands to play Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux. As always there will also be a review of all \nthe goals and incidents from Saturday's matches - with the analysis led by MOTD2 regular, Lee Dixon.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d7ae030e37dc51143c715853fa1d73e4b589349","amp;dn":"Match+Of+The+Day+-+2+-+6th+November+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d7ae030e37dc51143c715853fa1d73e4b589349","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,122,224,48,227,125,197,17,67,199,21,133,63,161,215,62,75,88,147,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
