Stuck on a bus across 2,000 miles of dustbowl roads with these passionate believers, Maxwell tackles some firmly held beliefs - could the Earth be only 6,000 years old, and did humans and T-Rex really live side by side? It's a bumpy ride as he's confronted with some lively debates along the way, but by the end could he possibly win over any of these believers with what he regards as hard scientific fact?\n\nFirst broadcast: BBC Three, 9:00PM Mon, 8 Oct 2012\nDuration: 60 minutes\nKey talent: Andrew Maxwell","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64e9fea597414504eebc6d55ad8162e525bc1ef5","amp;dn":"BBC%3A+Conspiracy+Road+Trip+-+2.+Creationism","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64e9fea597414504eebc6d55ad8162e525bc1ef5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,233,254,165,151,65,69,4,238,188,109,85,173,129,98,229,37,188,30,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
