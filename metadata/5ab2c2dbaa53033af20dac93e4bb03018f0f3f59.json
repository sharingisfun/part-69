Refusing to commit suicide with his superiors or be forced into camps for prisoners of war, Captain Oba Sakae (Takenouchi Yutaka) leads a group of his men and other similarly minded local residents into the mountains. Even after hearing reports of the Japanese militaryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s surrender, Oba dismisses the reports as propaganda and continues to launch guerilla attacks against the American soldiers, earning him the nickname Ã¢â‚¬Å“The FoxÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Soon, even the American commander whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s charged with the task of capturing Oba comes to admire his persistent enemy.\n\n\nScreen Shots\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img835/2626/43078.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img835/2626/43078.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ab2c2dbaa53033af20dac93e4bb03018f0f3f59","amp;dn":"Oba+The+Last+Samurai+%282011%29+720p+Eng+Bluray+_GRT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ab2c2dbaa53033af20dac93e4bb03018f0f3f59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,178,194,219,170,83,3,58,242,13,172,147,228,187,3,1,143,15,63,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
