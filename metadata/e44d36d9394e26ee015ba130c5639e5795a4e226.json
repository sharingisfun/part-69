For Britain had not just lost a prince: during his twenty year marriage to Queen Victoria, Prince Albert had increasingly performed the function of King in all but name. The outpouring of grief after AlbertÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death was so extreme, that its like would not be seen again until the death of Princess Diana 136 years later.\n\nDrawing on many letters, diaries and memoirs from the Royal Archives and other neglected sources, as well as the newspapers of the day, Rappaport offers a new perspective on this compelling historical psychodrama--the crucial final months of the princeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life and the first long, dark ten years of the QueenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s retreat from public view. She draws a portrait of a queen obsessed with her living husband and Ã¢â‚¬â€œ after his death Ã¢â‚¬â€œ with his enduring place in history. Magnificent Obsession will also throw new light on the true nature of the princeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s chronic physical condition, overturning for good the 150-year old myth that he died of typhoid fever\n\nEnjoy!!\n\nTam&amp;Carla","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e44d36d9394e26ee015ba130c5639e5795a4e226","amp;dn":"A_Magnificent_Obsession_By_Helen_Rappaport_epub_Tam.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e44d36d9394e26ee015ba130c5639e5795a4e226","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,77,54,217,57,78,38,238,1,91,161,48,197,99,158,87,149,164,226,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
