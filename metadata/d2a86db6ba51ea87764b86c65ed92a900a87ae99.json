The Older Brother's Wish, the Younger Sister's Wish (.mp4)(480p)\n\nIchigo discovers that one of his classmates, Orihime Inoue, is stalked by her older brother's spirit who turned into a hollow, which makes him hesitate to fulfill his duty. As Ichigo is forced to use his power again, his qualms of killing hollows are rested and he finally submits to his purpose as a substitute Soul Reaper. \n\n004. Cursed Parakeet (.mp4)(480p)\n\nIchigoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s friend Yasutora &quot;Chad&quot; Sado comes into possession of a cursed cockatiel that is inhabited by the soul of a small boy. The curse, which brings misfortune to anyone who possesses it, is really due to the acts of a hollow that has been stalking the boy's soul. Chad is attacked by the hollow, but with Rukia's help, they face off against the hollow. \n\n005. Beat the Invisible Enemy! (.mp4)(480p)\n\nWith Rukia's help, Chad fights the hollow despite not being able to see it. Ichigo eventually arrives and defeats the hollow, but unlike the previous hollows that simply dissolved and went to the Soul Society, the gates of Hell appear and capture the hollow. The spirit that inhabited the cockatiel is released to move on to the Soul Society. \n\nUploader Notes:\n===============\n\nUse VLC Player for best results.\n\nSeed and enjoy... :)\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2a86db6ba51ea87764b86c65ed92a900a87ae99","amp;dn":"Bleach+Ep.+3-5+%28Eng.+Sub%29+%5BSpeedy+Joe%5D+%5BPirateBoyTPB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2a86db6ba51ea87764b86c65ed92a900a87ae99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,168,109,182,186,81,234,135,118,75,134,198,94,217,42,144,10,135,174,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
