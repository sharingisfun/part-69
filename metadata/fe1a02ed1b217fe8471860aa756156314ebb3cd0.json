Too many emails and request on the forums leftÃ¢â‚¬Â¦I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have reply maybe at all in many places but I have carefully read almost all your post/request so this is my gift to all of you wherever you are and enjoy.[/color][/b][/center]\n \n[center][IMG]http://img687.imageshack.us/img687/7531/androidkb.jpg[/IMG][/center]\n\n[center][IMG]http://imageshack.us/a/img853/1586/app1x.png[/IMG][/center]\n\n[center][IMG]http://imageshack.us/a/img338/4118/app2p.png[/IMG][/center]\n\n[center][IMG]http://imageshack.us/a/img803/2669/app3.png[/IMG][/center]\n\n[center][IMG]http://imageshack.us/a/img201/1999/app4.png[/IMG][/center]\n\n[center][IMG]http://imageshack.us/a/img802/7061/app5.png[/IMG][/center]\n\n[center][IMG]http://imageshack.us/a/img163/7769/app6.png[/IMG][/center]\n\n[center][IMG]http://imageshack.us/a/img819/3968/app7.png[/IMG][/center]\n\n[center][b][color=blue]The next picture are apps for rooted phones so they can work properly.[/color][/b][/center]\n\n[center][IMG]http://imageshack.us/a/img822/8753/app8.png[/IMG][/center]\n\n[center][b][color=blue]The torrent is in one rar package. The reason is very simple, to have a proper seeding and last more longer. An example is if is unpacked one person will download one app, second will download other app and so on...the person who will download only the application that he like after that he will not seed the other parts and the torrent very soon will die eventualy. So excuse me for that but is logic for me to be in one rar package so everybody can access and download faster.[/color][/b][/center]\n\n[b]Enjoy and don't forget to SeeD[/b]\n[IMG]http://img169.imageshack.us/img169/2485/seed.gif[/IMG]\n[img]http://techzblog.in/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/android.gif[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe1a02ed1b217fe8471860aa756156314ebb3cd0","amp;dn":"StoneBoyTony+Android+MEGAPack+v3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe1a02ed1b217fe8471860aa756156314ebb3cd0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,26,2,237,27,33,127,232,71,24,96,170,117,97,86,49,78,187,60,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
