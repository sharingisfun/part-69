Despite critical acclaim and support from DJ John Peel who featured them on his &quot;Perfumed Garden&quot; radio show, the band was not a great success in commercial terms. They were among the first psychedelic bands in England along with Pink Floyd and Soft Machine. Tomorrow recorded the first ever John Peel show session on BBC Radio 1 on 21 September 1967.\n\nHere are the 2 official releases from Tomorrow.\n\nTomorrow - Tomorrow (256 Kbps)\n1.
