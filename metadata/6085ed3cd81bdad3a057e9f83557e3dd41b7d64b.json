Ed asked U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer and Allen Raymond (author of &quot;How to Rig an Election&quot;).\n\nThen, do Republicans want to cheat because they have a candidate who is losing?  Democratic Strategist Bob Shrum joined Ed for Romney's bad week that just got worse today.\n\nIs Mitt Romney's &quot;47 percent&quot; remark the biggest game changer in the history of presidential politics?  The Nation's John Nichols had the answer.\n\nRNC Chairman Reince Priebus flip-floped on supporting Todd &quot;forcible rape&quot; Akin.  Michelle Goldberg (Senior Contributing Writer for Newsweek and the Daily Beast), and Ari Melber (Correspondent for The Nation, joined Ed for that.)\n\nAnd in the Big Finish, Mitt Romney is doing his best to make trade with China an issue in this election, but the facts keep catching up with him.  Ed had that with Rep. John Garamendi (D-CA).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6085ed3cd81bdad3a057e9f83557e3dd41b7d64b","amp;dn":"The+Ed+Show+9-28-12.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6085ed3cd81bdad3a057e9f83557e3dd41b7d64b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,133,237,60,216,27,218,211,160,87,233,248,53,87,227,221,65,183,214,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
