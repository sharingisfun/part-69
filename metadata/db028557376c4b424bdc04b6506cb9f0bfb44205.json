Hell, even THIS one is already out there minus the extras. I picked this up over at WHAT dot CD about two years ago hoping to build ratio, and (thanks to the insane policies of that site) I just FINALLY seeded it back. Now, I just want to get the damned thing off my hard drive, but I figured I would make available to the free torrent world first.\n\nIf you love the Grateful Dead, here are the famous Wonderland concerts from 1977, FLAC, with complete scan and album information. Below are the stats for a typical track. I will say this for WHAT dot CD, their quality standards for a torrent are excellent. I just wish it was not geared to folks with a larger European bandwidth, since this makes it almost impossible to build ratio there. I have been force seeding ten torrents for over a year, and have seeded back eleven GB. Everyone is terrified to leech, because they know they will never seed. All hail the Pirate Bay!\n\nEditorial Reviews\n\nWinterland June 1977: The Complete Recordings presents the legendary 3-night run (June 7, 8, 9) that marked the band's triumphant return from one of the greatest tours in rock 'n' roll history. Winterland's relaxed atmosphere truly brings out the best as the guys deliver six inspired sets of free-flowing creativity and peak musicianship.\n\nCompletists rejoice -- 9 full discs, 68 tracks of prime time Dead! Experience all 3 shows from start-to-finish as every note from the analog masters has been brought back to distortion-free, pitch-perfect reality using Plangent Processes. Adding to the bliss, the restored audio has been lovingly mastered to HDCD by Jeffrey Norman.\n\nWinterland June 1977 is the faithful companion to last year's standard-setting set, Winterland 1973. It features archival packaging, cover art by Emek, a 28-page booklet with an insightful essay by Rolling Stone's David Fricke, along with lots of amazing photos and a few surprises.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dead.net/features/dead-world-roundup/winterland-june-1977-complete-recordings&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dead.net/features/dead-world-roundup/winterland-june-1977-complete-recordings&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/oAKdfAADN&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/oAKdfAADN&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFormat                           : FLAC\nFormat/Info                      : Free Lossless Audio Codec\nFile size                        : 16.4 MiB\nDuration                         : 3mn 6s\nOverall bit rate                 : 740 Kbps\nAlbum                            : Winterland June 1977: The Complete Recordings\nPart                             : 1\nPart/Total                       : 10\nTrack name                       : Funiculi Funicula\nTrack name/Position              : 06\nTrack name/Total                 : 9\nPerformer                        : Grateful Dead\nGenre                            : Rock\nRecorded date                    : 2009\nComment                          : Winterland, June 7, 1977 - Disc 1\n\nAudio\nFormat                           : FLAC\nFormat/Info                      : Free Lossless Audio Codec\nDuration                         : 3mn 6s\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 739 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 44.1 KHz\nBit depth                        : 16 bits\nStream size                      : 16.4 MiB (100%)\nWriting library                  : libFLAC 1.2.1 (UTC 2007-09-17)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db028557376c4b424bdc04b6506cb9f0bfb44205","amp;dn":"Grateful+Dead+1977+Wonderland+-+FLAC+-+Complete%2C+Scans","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db028557376c4b424bdc04b6506cb9f0bfb44205","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,2,133,87,55,108,75,66,75,220,4,182,80,108,185,240,191,180,66,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
