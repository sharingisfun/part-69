Also, with a Double U-Turn on the line, \nteams must choose whether to sabotage their \nfellow Racers for a chance at first place.\n\n(Rules are unclear if a show such as this would\nbe 'reality' or 'competitive reality'. Due to\nthis being a literal race involving lots of\nrunning and high motion we went with \n'competitive'.\n\n22/Slower\nEvolve...or die.\n\nEnjoy :)\nmadcow at hushmail dot com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26ca6161dd4669341ea35674ba1550509ec62049","amp;dn":"The.Amazing.Race.S19E07.720p.HDTV.X264-DIMENSION","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26ca6161dd4669341ea35674ba1550509ec62049","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,202,97,97,221,70,105,52,30,163,86,116,186,21,80,80,158,198,32,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
