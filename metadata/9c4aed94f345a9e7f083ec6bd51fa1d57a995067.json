Sorry for the wait. I hope you all went to that other upload for the final few episodes of the Tournament of Champions. WHAT AN ENDING, AMIRITE?\n\nIn any case, I've got a new tuner card, and I'm going to set up my broken one as a backup in case the primary card goes to shit.\n\nHere's the episode from Nov 16 in SD (no HD yet, sorry) with commercials included. I encourage you to watch the commercials and support Jeopardy's sponsors, as they pay lots to bring this show to you.\n\nThe new uploads will be about twice as big as the old ones, at least until I can figure out the conversion settings again. The new episodes are also in .ts, which can be played in VLC, but might not work on all mobile devices. I will be fixing this within the week. If it bothers you a whole lot, you can Google the phrase &quot;ts to mp4 converter&quot;.\n\nCOMMENT AND SEED, PLEASE... This is the only way I'll know if this is worth my time. I will try to get the HD back soon.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c4aed94f345a9e7f083ec6bd51fa1d57a995067","amp;dn":"Jeopardy+%5BSD%5D+16.NOV.2011+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c4aed94f345a9e7f083ec6bd51fa1d57a995067","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,74,237,148,243,69,169,231,240,131,236,107,213,31,161,213,122,153,80,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
