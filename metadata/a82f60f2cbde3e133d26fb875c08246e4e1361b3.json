I don't think it can be run 100% fine using cogswap on a PSX/PS2, because it features 60 audio tracks and reads subchannel data.\n\nHow to play\n\n1) On a chipped PSX or PS2\n\t\nBurn the image with a decent CD-Burning software and good media. I use CloneCD 4.0.1.4 and Verbatim CD-R. My write settings: Write speed 16x, &quot;Amplify weak sectors&quot; unchecked, &quot;Don't repair SubChannel Data&quot; unchecked, &quot;Always close last Session&quot; checked. Burn CD and put it on your chipped PSX or PS2. It should work.\n\t\n2) On ePSXe 1.7.0\n\n&quot;File-&gt;Run ISO&quot; won't work. The game will load, but you'll get choppy audio track playback.\nInstall DaemonTools (I use version 4.45.1.0236). It will ask to restart, do it. Add a SCSI drive (a DT one won't work, don't ask me why). Mount the .ccd file on this drive.\nOn ePSXe go &quot;Config-&gt;Cdrom&quot;. Select &quot;ePSXe CDR WNT/W2K core 1.7.0&quot;. Press &quot;Configure&quot; button. Select letter of the Virtual Drive you created with DaemonTools. Check &quot;Enable subchannel read from cdrom. (maybe slow!!!)&quot;.\nNow do &quot;File-&gt;Run CDROM&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a82f60f2cbde3e133d26fb875c08246e4e1361b3","amp;dn":"%5BPSX%5D+%5BPAL-E%5D+%5BSLES-00718%5D+Tomb+Raider+II","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a82f60f2cbde3e133d26fb875c08246e4e1361b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,47,96,242,203,222,62,19,61,38,251,135,92,8,36,110,78,19,97,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
