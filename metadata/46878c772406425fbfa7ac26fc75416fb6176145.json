On that occasion Shola Ameobi netted a late equaliser for Newcastle, who have only lost one of their last 15 games against the Black Cats.\n\nThe day's other game sees QPR meet Everton at Loftus Road, where the Toffees have only won once in the last 25 years. Rangers narrowly avoided relegation on the final day of last season, but will expect a better performance this season following the signing of high-profile trio Julio Cesar, Park Ji-Sung and Esteban Granero.\n\nColin and guests also look back at the goals from Saturday's eight matches.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46878c772406425fbfa7ac26fc75416fb6176145","amp;dn":"Match+of+the+Day+Two+21.10.2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46878c772406425fbfa7ac26fc75416fb6176145","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,135,140,119,36,6,66,95,191,167,172,38,252,117,65,111,182,23,97,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
