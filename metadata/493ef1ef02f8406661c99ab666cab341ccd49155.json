They were designated 60 years ago as places for everyone, but is that still the case? In this series the award-winning filmmaker Richard Macer spent a year amid conflicts in three different parks, on a journey to discover who they are really for. \n\nIn each park (the other two are the Peak District and Loch Lomond) the stories are very different, but there is something that unites them all - fiercely divided communities who are prepared to fight in order to preserve their right to enjoy the countryside. In each film Macer has secured access to the National Park Authority - an organisation which looks after the landscapes and decides upon planning matters. In all these stories the Park Authorities have a key role to play in trying to find amicable solutions to the problems which confront them.\n\n\n\n1/3 How an entrepreneur tried to build a giant zip-wire ride on a Lake District mountain.\n \n2/3 A look at a campaign to stop motorists overusing the Peak District villages' green lanes.\n\n3/3 Will the Loch Lomond Park Authority give permission for Scotland's first goldmine?\n\n\n\n\nTales From The National Parks - S01 - E01 - The Lake District\nTales From The National Parks - S01 - E02 - The Peak District\nTales From The National Parks - S01 - E03 - Loch Lomond And The Trossachs\n\n\n\n\nVideo\nCodec ID                                 : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                            : XviD\nDuration                                 : 58mn 25s\nBit rate                                 : 1 557 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 672 pixels\nHeight                                   : 384 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                           : Version 1\nFormat profile                           : Layer 3\nMode                                     : Joint stereo\nMode extension                           : MS Stereo\nCodec ID                                 : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                            : MP3\nDuration                                 : 58mn 25s\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 106 Kbps\nNominal bit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:493ef1ef02f8406661c99ab666cab341ccd49155","amp;dn":"BBC+-+Tales+From+The+National+Parks+-+Series+01+-+TVrip+-+Xvid+-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"493ef1ef02f8406661c99ab666cab341ccd49155","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,62,241,239,2,248,64,102,97,201,154,182,102,202,179,65,204,212,145,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
