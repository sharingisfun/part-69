You do not need cyanogenmod 7 to use this theme. It is only recommended you get the cm7 theme for the full effect. This adw theme inludes several docks and icons and will be updated daily with newly requested icons made. \n\ndock is built in to get pngs go to my xda thread\nRead through the threads on xda. The clock with the weather is mClock and that is a skin I made. Also the miui clock. The transparent stausbar needs a patch be activated as well as the center clock. If you have a question contact me on xda or email me. Not ask with a comment cause I won't read it. That is very informal. The icons are included. If you want the icons, docks, and other stuff in picture format I suggest you visit my thread at xda http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthr ... ?t=1243590 (full features list is there)\nThis theme will work on ANY phone with the theme chooser app not just cm7 and this apk works on ALL resolutions,\n\n                                By bobiras2009\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80bd72aa8a0480fefe144dbcf4309d9cb5ad2ee8","amp;dn":"LunarUi+-+Adw+%28Full%29+v2.0+By+bobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80bd72aa8a0480fefe144dbcf4309d9cb5ad2ee8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,189,114,170,138,4,128,254,254,20,77,188,244,48,157,156,181,173,46,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
