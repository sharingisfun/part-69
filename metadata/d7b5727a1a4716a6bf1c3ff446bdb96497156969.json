Elizabeth Blaine, working at the New Orleans morgue, receives Dracula's 'corpse' from her friend &amp; co-worker Luke following the events of Dracula 2000. (This is a departure from the epilogue of the first film, in which Mary Van Helsing explains in a voiceover that she had returned Dracula to London and assumed her father's duties as Dracula's keeper.)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7b5727a1a4716a6bf1c3ff446bdb96497156969","amp;dn":"Dracula+II%3A+Ascension","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7b5727a1a4716a6bf1c3ff446bdb96497156969","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,181,114,122,26,71,22,166,191,28,63,244,70,189,185,100,151,21,105,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
