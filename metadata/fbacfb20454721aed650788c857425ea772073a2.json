A national consortium of state politicians and powerful corporations, ALEC presents itself as a Ã¢â‚¬Å“nonpartisan public-private partnershipÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. But behind that mantra lies a vast network of corporate lobbying and political action aimed to increase corporate profits at public expense without public knowledge.\n\nUsing interviews, documents, and field reporting, the episode explores ALECÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s self-serving machine at work, acting in a way one Wisconsin politician describes as Ã¢â‚¬Å“a corporate dating service for lonely legislators and corporate special interests.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nIn state houses around the country, hundreds of pieces of boilerplate ALEC legislation are proposed or enacted that would, among other things, dilute collective bargaining rights, make it harder for some Americans to vote, and limit corporate liability for harm caused to consumers Ã¢â‚¬â€ each accomplished without the public ever knowing whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s behind it.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“All of us here are very familiar with ALEC and the influence that ALEC has with many of the [legislative] members,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ says Arizona State Senator Steve Farley. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Corporations have the right to present their arguments, but they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have the right to do it secretly.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“United States of ALECÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a collaboration between Okapi Productions, LLC and the Schumann Media Center, headed by Bill Moyers, which supports independent journalism and public watchdogs including the Center for Media and Democracy, whose investigators are featured in the report.\n\nAlso on the Moyers &amp; Company broadcast, master media decoder Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the University of PennsylvaniaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Annenberg Public Policy Center and founder of FactCheck.org, joins Bill to discuss a recent Annenberg Center report that reveals widespread ignorance of the presidential candidatesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ major policy positions.\n\nThe two also view and assess the veracity of Obama and RomneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recent  TV ads, and talk about the potential impact of upcoming presidential and vice presidential debates.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been studying presidential debates for a long time as a scholarly community,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Jamieson tells Bill. Ã¢â‚¬Å“And to our surprise, we consistently find that those who watch debates, regardless of the level of knowledge they come in with, come out with more accurate knowledge as a general group.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbacfb20454721aed650788c857425ea772073a2","amp;dn":"United+States+of+ALEC+Moyers+and+Company+093012-PBS+avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbacfb20454721aed650788c857425ea772073a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,172,251,32,69,71,33,174,214,80,120,140,133,116,37,234,119,32,115,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
