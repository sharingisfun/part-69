Simply select the bloatware that you want to get rid of and click delete.

Important features might break when deleting system apps.\n\nROOT &amp; BUSYBOX REQUIRED !\n\nUsing the blacklist in the full version, you can swiftly get rid of all bloatware after installing a new ROM. When wiping your phone's data, you can export your blacklist to import it on your new ROM.\n\nYou're advised to try the free version before buying. Not all ROMs allow NoBloat to work.\n\nFeatures:\n\n    Disabling and enabling system apps \n    Creating backups of system apps and restoring them \n    Deleting system apps \n    Creating a blacklist of system app to delete \n    Batch operation to backup/remove all blacklisted system apps \n    Batch operation to enable all disabled system apps \n    Batch operation to restore all backups \n    Export your settings and blacklist to external storage to import them later \n\nNotes:\nIn order to use NoBloat you need root access and busybox.

It is advised to always have a backup of deleted apps or to just disable them so you can restore them later.\n\nDisclaimer:\nTVK Development cannot be held responsible for any damage you may cause.\nRemoving critical apps can cause your phone to malfunction.
