When finally green lit, it set off an incredible race against time to form and train a new squadron. Their mission was to deliver a weapon that did not yet exist.\nUnprecedented by any scale, and even more remarkable because the crews were not the experienced elite that legend sometimes suggests, Holland believes this truly is the greatest raid of all time. Yet, whilst arguing that the true impact of the successful raid has been underestimated, he also sets out to investigate whether the results should have been even greater.\n\n59:03\n\nAVC 1080i &gt; x264 720p\nAC3 stream copy\n\nenjoy\n\nPls help seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57260fcfe56074f70124fb2dd55569ed56be8c5d","amp;dn":"BBC-HD+Dam+Busters_+The+Race+to+Smash+the+German+Dams+x264+AC3+7","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57260fcfe56074f70124fb2dd55569ed56be8c5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,38,15,207,229,96,116,247,1,36,251,45,213,85,105,237,86,190,140,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
