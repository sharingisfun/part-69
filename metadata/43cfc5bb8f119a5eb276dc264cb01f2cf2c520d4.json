Five years passed since the Second Disaster, which eclipsed the events of April 1986. The Zone is shaken by frequent and powerful blowouts, which move anomaly fields, opening new routes to previously inaccessible locations. Stalker factions fight for the new territories and key points. A lot of stalkers die, but newbies keep on arriving.\n\nThe action takes place one year prior to the events of S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl, one year before Strelok's most successful trip to the center of the Zone Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the third one. We will learn about Strelok and his squad from another character's vantage point.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43cfc5bb8f119a5eb276dc264cb01f2cf2c520d4","amp;dn":"S.T.A.L.K.E.R.+Clear+Sky+ENG.PC.RePAK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43cfc5bb8f119a5eb276dc264cb01f2cf2c520d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,207,197,187,143,17,154,94,178,118,220,38,76,176,31,44,242,197,32,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
