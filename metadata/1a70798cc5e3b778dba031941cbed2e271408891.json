In mixed-mode device and circuit simulation, numerically simulated devices can be embedded in circuits consisting of compact device models and passive elements.\n\nMinimos-NT is integrated with a state-of-the-art TCAD Framework. A comprehensive set of physical models enables the user to simulate various kinds of advanced device structures, such as present-day CMOS devices, silicon-on-insulator devices, and hetero-structure devices. Taking into account atomistic traps and dopants, MINIMOS-NT allows reliability and variability modeling of highly scaled transistors such as bulk planar devices silicon-on-insulator FinFETs with a channel length down to 22 nm and below.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a70798cc5e3b778dba031941cbed2e271408891","amp;dn":"minimos-nt-2.1-install-linux.tar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a70798cc5e3b778dba031941cbed2e271408891","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,112,121,140,197,227,183,120,219,160,49,148,28,190,210,226,113,64,136,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
