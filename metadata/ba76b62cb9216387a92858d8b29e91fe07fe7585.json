It continues to stand out among other action RPGs for its seamless gameplay that anyone from beginner to veteran can enjoy.\nOne of the most memorable elements of the Mana series is the Ring Command menu system. With the single press of a button, a ring-shaped menu appears on the screen, where players can use items, change weapons, and do a variety of other actions without needing to switch screens. This Ring Command menu system for which the Mana series is so well known was first introduced in Secret of Mana and has since appeared in most games in the series.\nPlay as Randi and his two companions, Primm and Popoi, as they adventure all around the world. At the center of our epic story is the mystical power of Mana. Battle the empire in its quest for control of Mana. Befriend the eight elementals who wield the forces of nature itself. Numerous encounters await at every turn.\n\nJailbroken Iphone's only, with AppSynch via Cydia.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba76b62cb9216387a92858d8b29e91fe07fe7585","amp;dn":"Secret+Of+Mana+V+2.00+%5B.ipa%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba76b62cb9216387a92858d8b29e91fe07fe7585","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,118,182,44,185,33,99,135,169,40,88,216,178,158,145,254,7,254,117,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
