She just happens to make one terrible mistake her junior year in high school which costs her ten months in juvenile detention. Now a senior, she's lost everything: her best friend, the trust of her parents, driving privileges, Internet access. It's a lonely existence.\n\nBut there is one bright spot: Mark Connelly, her very cute, very off-limits 28-year-old calculus teacher. She falls hard for him--a ridiculous schoolgirl crush headed nowhere. She can't help it. He's the only good thing at Crestview High. She doesn't expect him to reciprocate her feelings. How inappropriate, right? But he does. And he shows her.\n\nAnd that's when her life goes from bad to good.\n\nBook 1 in the Too Good series. This series will be a two-parter. The second and final book is called Better, and will be released Tuesday, November 19, 2013.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db9823ebe17ec4325d4998483105b02af1d07957","amp;dn":"Good+%28Too+Good+Series+1%29+By+S++Walden+%28epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db9823ebe17ec4325d4998483105b02af1d07957","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,152,35,235,225,126,196,50,93,73,152,72,49,5,176,42,241,208,121,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
