It is capable of displaying a temperature of each individual core of every processor in your system!\nYou can see temperature fluctuations in real time with varying workloads. Core Temp is also motherboard agnostic.\n\nAll major processor manufacturers have implemented a &quot;DTS&quot; (Digital Thermal Sensor) in their products. The DTS provides more accurate and higher resolution temperature readings than conventional onboard thermal sensors. (How does it work?).\nThis feature is supported by all recent x86 processors. Processors by Intel, AMD and VIA are supported. A complete list of supported processors is available.\nCore Temp is easy to use, while also enabling a high level of customization and expandability.\nCore Temp provides a platform for plug-ins, which allows developers to add new features and extend its functionality. You can find our plug-ins and add-ons here.\nIf you are a developer and you are interested in creating your own addition, please see the developer's page.\n\n***************************************\nCPU-Z 1.61\n*************************************** &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html#whatiscpuz&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html#whatiscpuz&lt;/a&gt;\nCPU-Z is a freeware that gathers information on some of the main devices of your system. \nCPU\nName and number. \nCore stepping and process. \nPackage. \nCore voltage. \nInternal and external clocks, clock multiplier. \nSupported instruction sets. \nCache information.\nMainboard\nVendor, model and revision. \nBIOS model and date. \nChipset (northbridge and southbridge) and sensor. \nGraphic interface.\nMemory\nFrequency and timings. \nModule(s) specification using SPD (Serial Presence Detect) : vendor, serial number, timings table.\nSystem\nWindows and DirectX version.\n\n***************************************\nHWMonitor 1.20\n*************************************** &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.cpuid.com/softwares/hwmonitor.html#whatishwmonitor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.cpuid.com/softwares/hwmonitor.html#whatishwmonitor&lt;/a&gt;\nHWMonitor is a hardware monitoring program that reads PC systems main health sensors : voltages, temperatures, fans speed.\nThe program handles the most common sensor chips, like ITEÃ‚Â® IT87 series, most WinbondÃ‚Â® ICs, and others. In addition, it can read modern CPUs on-die core thermal sensors, as well has hard drives temperature via S.M.A.R.T, and video card GPU temperature.\n\nSpecial hardware monitors such as abitÃ‚Â® uGuru and GigabyteÃ‚Â® ODINÃ¢â€žÂ¢ power supplies serie are supported too. \n\n***************************************\nGPU-Z 0.6.5\n*************************************** &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.techpowerup.com/gpuz/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.techpowerup.com/gpuz/&lt;/a&gt;\nGPU-Z is a lightweight utility designed to give you all information about your video card and GPU.\n\nMain Features\nSupport NVIDIA and ATI cards \nDisplays adapter, GPU and display information \nDisplays overclock, default clocks and 3D clocks (if available) \nIncludes a GPU load test to verify PCI-Express lane configuration \nValidation of results \nNo installation required \nSupport for Windows 2000 / XP / Vista / Windows 7 (both 32 and 64 bit versions are supported) \n.. and yes, the author of CPU-Z has granted us permission to use a name similar to his product.
