Crysis Warhead is a stand-alone expansion game and does not require Crysis installed to play.\n\nCrysis Warhead updates and refines the gameplay of the original game through a side-plot parallel to that of the original game. The story follows Sergeant Michael &quot;Psycho&quot; Sykes, an ally of Crysis protagonist Nomad, as he faces his own trials and challenges on the other side of the island during the time period of the first game. It features new fully customizable weapons, vehicles and enemies, along with new multiplayer content. It also showcases a new, enhanced and optimized version of CryEngine 2 and is the first game developed by Crytek's Budapest studio.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40bb618bab64337a996f16ead02dbd81800e13cb","amp;dn":"Crysis+Warhead","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40bb618bab64337a996f16ead02dbd81800e13cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,187,97,139,171,100,51,122,153,111,22,234,208,45,189,129,128,14,19,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
