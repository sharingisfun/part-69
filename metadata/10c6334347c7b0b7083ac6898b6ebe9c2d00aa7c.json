Because, as you may know, in those \ndays the portable recording units, then euphemistically called \n&quot;Walkman&quot;, were still steam engine driven. That you will certainly \nfancy yourselves from the rather poor sound quality of this recording.\nHowever, there don't seem to exist so many copies at all, hence I \ndare to publish mine. But the music will pay back your loss at any \nrate.\n\nTechnically, the recording consists of four parts, corresponding \nto the two Maxell XL-II C90 tapes I ripped them from. The parts are\noverlapping, thus you can sew them together quite easily. No noise\nreduction or any processing have been applied to the playback on \nmy side, the data you get are as retrieved from the tapes.\n(Unfortunately they comprise in the first 15 or so minutes the \nignorant babble of that Lady on the left channel. If I had attended \nthe concert myself back then, I certainly would have stuffed her \nmouth or dropped her off the cliff. Never liked that brat anyway.)\n\n\nTrack list:\n==========================================\nTape 1, Side A (46:08):\n------------------------------------------\nPlainsong\nPictures of You\nClosedown\nThe Kyoto Song\nA Night Like This\nJust Like Heaven\nLast Dance\nFascination Street\nCold (uncomplete)\n\n------------------------------------------\nTape 1, Side B (46:22):\n------------------------------------------\nCold\nCharlotte Sometimes\nThe Walk\nA Forest\nInbetween Days\nThe Same Deep Water as You\nPrayers for Rain\nDisintegration (uncomplete)\n\n------------------------------------------\nTape 2, Side A (46:12):\n------------------------------------------\nDisintegration\nLullaby\nClose to Me\nLet's Go to Bed\nWhy Can't I Be You?\nThe Figurehead\nThree Imaginary Boys\nBoys Don't Cry\nHomesick (uncomplete)\n\n------------------------------------------\nTape 2, Side B (28:23):\n------------------------------------------\nHomesick\nUntitled\nFaith\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10c6334347c7b0b7083ac6898b6ebe9c2d00aa7c","amp;dn":"The+Cure+-+Loreley%2C+1989","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10c6334347c7b0b7083ac6898b6ebe9c2d00aa7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,198,51,67,71,199,176,183,8,58,198,137,139,110,190,156,45,0,170,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
