He was a playwright, novelist, poet, and short story writer. Wilde spent two years in a hard labor prison after being convicted of gross indecency. The Canterville Ghost is a novella parody featuring an ambassador and a spirit. The ambassador moves his family into a castle, which is known to be haunted.\n\nThe Canterville Ghost&quot; is a popular short story by Oscar Wilde, widely adapted for the screen and stage. It was the first of Wilde's stories to be published, appearing in the magazine The Court and Society Review in February 1887. It was later included in a collection of short stories entitled Lord Arthur Savile's Crime and Other Stories in 1891.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Utpal &amp; Jayant\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCover::   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img833/4669/thecantervilleghostbyos.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img833/4669/thecantervilleghostbyos.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nUploader:                                  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img402.imageshack.us/img402/4747/uploadera.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img402.imageshack.us/img402/4747/uploadera.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n                                  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/AshUtpal&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/AshUtpal&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f577e099cde830819115f33a8924357ffa25ca7f","amp;dn":"The+Canterville+Ghost+by+Oscar+Wilde+%5BUJ%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f577e099cde830819115f33a8924357ffa25ca7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,119,224,153,205,232,48,129,145,21,243,58,137,36,53,127,250,37,202,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
