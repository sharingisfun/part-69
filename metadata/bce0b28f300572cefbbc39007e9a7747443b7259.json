In the present days, the same signal is transmitted from a base in Malvinas Island to United States of America, and a satellite captures images of a unknown object in Antartic. The cryptologist Julien Rome (James Spader) is invited to investigate the mystery in the South Pole, and he flies to a research base. While a team tries to open a weird shell probably from the outer space, Julien solves the message, indeed a distress signal ordering not to open the case.\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0327409/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0327409/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bce0b28f300572cefbbc39007e9a7747443b7259","amp;dn":"Alien+Hunter+%282003%29%28IPOD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bce0b28f300572cefbbc39007e9a7747443b7259","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,224,178,143,48,5,114,206,251,188,57,0,126,154,119,71,68,59,114,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
