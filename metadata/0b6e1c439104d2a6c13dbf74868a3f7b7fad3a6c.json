Joe is both an accomplished axeman &amp; vocalist in his own right, with a huge following in Europe. This CD shows his return, a powerhouse performance recorded live in San Francisco with an all-star band featuring Tony Coleman, the man behind the battery for B.B. King &amp; Ike Turner. Features all originals seasoned with Joe's searing Telecaster licks.
