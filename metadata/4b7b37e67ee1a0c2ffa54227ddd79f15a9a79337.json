Because of the turn-based nature of the game, it can be played multi-player offline on one screen.\nFight on the randomly generated landscapes, even save and share them, which allows for a huge amount of multi-player map options!\nGET COMPETITIVE:\nPlay standard or ranked games in a bid to scale the Steam Leaderboards!\nMASSIVE CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS:\nPlayers are able to name their teams, choose which hats they want their worms to wear, whether they wear glasses, have moustaches, what they say, which flag represents them, and even what gravestone they leave behind when they die.\nWormsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ WEAPONS AND UTILITIES:\nMany of the classic WormsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ weapons are present and correct, with the Holy Hand Grenade, Bazooka, Dynamite, Banana Bomb, Baseball Bat, Super Sheep and many more in your arsenal of destruction.\nThere is also a sprinkling of even more crazy and surreal weapons too, such as Alien Abduction, Fatkins Strike, Flood, Inflatable Scouser, Old Woman, Starburst and Bovine Blitz with which to wage war on your enemies.\nCUSTOM BUILT WEAPONRY:\nPlayers are also able to construct their own weapons from a wide selection of components. These weapons are added to the playersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ arsenals and remain secret until deployed, giving opponents a nasty shock.\nTALK TRASH:\nIn-game voice-chat so you can cheer on team mates or indeed win the battle against opponents verbally!\nFULLY DESTRUCTIBLE ENVIRONMENTS:\nDeform everything in real-time.\nNEW PICTURE-IN-PICTURE DISPLAY:\nThis tracks every action a player makes when attacking, whilst at the same time allowing the player to retreat and not miss a single moment of the glorious action.\nNUMEROUS GAMEPLAY IMPROVEMENTS &amp; ENHANCEMENTS\nNew camera enhancements make it easier to follow the action; optimized AI means more intelligent enemies, and the addition of speech and lip-synching to the single-player missions makes for even more cinematic fun!\nNew visual improvements, with dynamic real time lighting and post process effects and shaders, make the mayhem look even more impressive.\nSystem Resources:\nOS: Windows 7 / Vista / XP\nProcessor: 3.0 GHz P4, Dual Core 2.0 (or higher) or AMD64X2 (or higher)\nMemory: 2GB\nGraphics: 512 MB NVIDIA GeForce 8400 / ATI Radeon HD 4650 or higher\nDirectXÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®: 9.0c\nHard Drive: At least 1.8 GB of Space\nSound: DirectX 9.0c compatible\nOther: Internet connection required","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b7b37e67ee1a0c2ffa54227ddd79f15a9a79337","amp;dn":"Worms+Ultimate+Mayhem+-+FULL+%2B+Crack+-+Foxy+Games","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b7b37e67ee1a0c2ffa54227ddd79f15a9a79337","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,123,55,230,126,225,160,194,255,165,66,39,221,215,159,21,169,167,147,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
