The contents of those suitcases, to the lament of a nearby jogger, was the dismembered body of a fellow student Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a Dutch woman named RenÃƒÂ©e Hartevelt, whom Sagawa had shot three days prior and had spent the days since eating various parts of her body.\n\nHe was soon arrested. According to reports, Issei uttered, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I killed her to eat her flesh,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ when they raided his home, whereupon they found bits of Renne still in his fridge.\n\nSagawa was declared insane and unfit for trial and was institutionalized in Paris. His incarceration was to be short, however, as the French public soon grew weary of their hard-earned francs going to support this evil woman-eater, and Issei was promptly deported. Herein followed a bizarre and seemingly too convenient set of legal loopholes and psychiatric reports that led doctors in Japan declaring him Ã¢â‚¬Å“sane, but evil.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nOn August 12, 1986, Sagawa checked himself out of TokyoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Matsuzawa Psychiatric hospital, and has been a free man ever since.\n\nThe suicide forest.\n\nAokigahara, also known as the Sea of Trees , is a 35-square-kilometre (14 sq mi) forest that lies at the northwest base of Mount Fuji in Japan. The forest contains a number of rocky, icy caverns, a few of which are popular tourist destinations. Due to the wind-blocking density of the trees and an absence of wildlife, the forest is known for being exceptionally quiet.\n\nThe forest has a historic association with demons in Japanese mythology and is a popular place for suicides; 54 committed the act in 2010,[2] despite numerous signs, in Japanese and English, urging people to reconsider their actions.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aokigahara&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aokigahara&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d6de8984cae6f6c1fd19168b8113cfe040de6b4","amp;dn":"Death+in+Japan-+Interview+with+a+canninbal+%26amp%3BThe+suicide+Fore","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d6de8984cae6f6c1fd19168b8113cfe040de6b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,109,232,152,76,174,111,108,31,209,145,104,184,17,60,254,4,13,230,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
