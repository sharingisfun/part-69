The math doesn't work out.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96963dcfe9b18709f24407d6891fa47af03a8cb7","amp;dn":"Barack+Obama+-+Serial+Liar.doc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96963dcfe9b18709f24407d6891fa47af03a8cb7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,150,61,207,233,177,135,9,242,68,7,214,137,31,164,122,240,58,140,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
