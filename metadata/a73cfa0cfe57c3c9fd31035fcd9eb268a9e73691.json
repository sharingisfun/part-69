By Rogero. Credits to the guy who leaked us the LV0 keys and zhang yong from BlueDisk who wanted to make $$$ from this and pushed the leaker into keaking... so no money for ReDRMers! Credits to eussNL and the PS3DevWiki for the valuable and always up-to-date source of information.\nCredits to Deank for his continuous efforts on Multiman and many other PS3 tools/fixes. But the Chinese were the ones that keep opening the door.. from original JB to TB to BlueDisk.. thank you! FUCK YOU TO THE DEVS WHO HAD THIS 6 MONTHS AGO BUT WERE TOO COOL TO SHARE.. YOU SAD MUMMY'S BOYS!\n\n\n\n\nNote for anyone who downgraded to 3.55 via hardware flasher: This CFW doesn't have LV1 checks disabled and can't be installed on Downgraded PS3 consoles unless you have Dehashed/Reset Syscon Properly (if you're not sure about your PS3, Dehash it anyway to avoid any risk). This applies to only a tiny percentage of users.\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy all the latest games without patching/dongling or any messing about!\n\n\n\nUpdate from 3.55 kmweaw or 3.55 OFW, if on 3.41 or TB. 3.56+ users will have to wait a bit for downgrade.\n\n\n\nCopy onto any USB stick, rename to PS3UPDAT.PUP, and install via XMB. That's it!\nUse this with multiMAN ver 04.07.01 FULL (20121021) - included in torrent. ***Change payload from Hermes to standard.****\n\n\n\nThis is not fake, check ps3hax, ps3crunch, psx-scene for confirmation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nROMNEY 2012!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a73cfa0cfe57c3c9fd31035fcd9eb268a9e73691","amp;dn":"PS3+4.21+CFW+-+Tested+and+Working%21%21+4.21+Rogero+%26amp%3B+Multiman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a73cfa0cfe57c3c9fd31035fcd9eb268a9e73691","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,60,250,12,254,87,195,201,253,49,3,95,205,158,178,104,169,231,54,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
