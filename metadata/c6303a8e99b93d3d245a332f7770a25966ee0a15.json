Ostensibly a documentary on the property and its occasional inhabitants, de OrbeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s film crisply conflates fictional and nonfictional practices with an eye towards the experimental, resulting in a personal essay on the intrinsic and spiritual value of the house in question. (de Orbe inherited the mansion from family, and spent three years filming it.) Once home to aristocrats or a decadent class, the buildingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s origins are unavoidable when contemplating its image on screen; cinematically, it conjures up allusions to the dwindling dynasty in The Leopard; while politically, it seems inseparable from the regionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s war-torn past (namely, the Spanish Civil War). But de Orbe is more fascinated by the architectureÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s waning life force than he is the ancestral context or historical burden of the siteÃ¢â‚¬â€a fading, if still breathing entity which history moves continuously through, rather than weighs heavily on.\n\n\n\nFile Name .........................................: Aita (JosÃƒÂ© MarÃƒÂ­a de Orbe, 2010).avi \nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 847,892,480 bytes \nRuntime ............................................: 1:22:28 \n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4 \nFrame Size ......................................: 720x400 (AR: 1.800) \nFPS .................................................: 25.000 \nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1172 kb/s \nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.163 bpp \nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [], [], [], [] \n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3 \nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz \nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 192 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR \nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n\n\n\nNot my rip.
