For the ones willing to enable back the chime, two commands are added disabling the precedent .\n\n The method works on Snow Leopard, Lion and Mountain Lion (successfully tested by  myself). For the ones suspicious about unknown scripts, double-click them and you will be able to check in TexEdit their very innocuous content strictly related to the topic.\n\nHoping this time by way of a zipped folder, the script files won't get corrupted.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90cdb1388fe7a873182fb51412059e02c56b051a","amp;dn":"0SX+Start-up+chime+disabler.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90cdb1388fe7a873182fb51412059e02c56b051a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,205,177,56,143,231,168,115,24,47,181,20,18,5,158,2,197,107,5,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
