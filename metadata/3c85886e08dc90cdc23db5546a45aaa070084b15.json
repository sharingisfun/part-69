The club competes in the choir competition circuit. It's been called &quot;a High School Musical for adults&quot;, the series follows the club and its mixture of oddball members as they try and restore it to its former glory. It is a musical comedy in which the eager and ambitious students not only compete to win the Nationals, but also have to deal with the tough and cruel realities of their school, McKinley High. At the same time, Will is trying to rejuvenate his failing love life whilst preventing the school's cheer leading coach Sue Sylvester from sabotaging the choir.\n\nGlee S01E01 Pilot\nGlee S01E02 Showmance\nGlee S01E03 Acafellas\nGlee S01E04 Preggers\nGlee S01E05 The Rhodes Not Taken\nGlee S01E06 Vitamin D\nGlee S01E07 Throwdown\nGlee S01E08 Mash-Up\nGlee S01E09 Wheels\nGlee S01E10 Ballad\nGlee S01E11 Hairography\nGlee S01E12 Mattress\nGlee S01E13 Sectionals\nGlee S01E14 Hell-O\nGlee S01E15 The Power of Madonna\nGlee S01E16 Home\nGlee S01E17 Bad Reputation\nGlee S01E18 Laryngitis\nGlee S01E19 Dream On\nGlee S01E20 Theatricality\nGlee S01E21 Funk\nGlee S01E22 Journey\n\nGlee S02E01 Audition\nGlee S02E02 Britney-Brittany\nGlee S02E03 Grilled Cheesus\nGlee S02E04 Duets\nGlee S02E05 The Rocky Horror Glee Show\nGlee S02E06 Never Been Kissed\nGlee S02E07 The Substitute\nGlee S02E08 Furt\nGlee S02E09 Special Education\nGlee S02E10 A Very Glee Christmas\nGlee S02E11 The Sue Sylvester Shuffle\nGlee S02E12 Silly Love Songs\nGlee S02E13 Comeback\nGlee S02E14 Blame It on the Alcohol\nGlee S02E15 Sexy\nGlee S02E16 Original Song\nGlee S02E17 A Night of Neglect\nGlee S02E18 Born This Way\nGlee S02E19 Rumours\nGlee S02E20 Prom Queen\nGlee S02E21 Funeral\nGlee S02E22 New York\n\nGlee S03E01 The Purple Piano Project\nGlee S03E02 I Am Unicorn\nGlee S03E03 Asian F\nGlee S03E04 Pot O' Gold\nGlee S03E05 The First Time\nGlee S03E06 Mash Off\nGlee S03E07 I Kissed A Girl\nGlee S03E08 Hold On To Sixteen\nGlee S03E09 Extraordinary Merry Christmas\nGlee S03E10 Yes/No\nGlee S03E11 Michael\nGlee S03E12 The Spanish Teacher\nGlee S03E13 Heart\nGlee S03E14 On My Way\nGlee S03E15 Big Brother\nGlee S03E16 Saturday Night Fever\nGlee S03E17 Dance with Somebody\nGlee S03E18 Choke\nGlee S03E19 Prom-asaurus\nGlee S03E20 Props\nGlee S03E21 Nationals\nGlee S03E22 Goodbye","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c85886e08dc90cdc23db5546a45aaa070084b15","amp;dn":"Glee+%28S1-3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c85886e08dc90cdc23db5546a45aaa070084b15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,133,136,110,8,220,144,205,194,61,181,84,106,69,170,160,112,8,75,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
