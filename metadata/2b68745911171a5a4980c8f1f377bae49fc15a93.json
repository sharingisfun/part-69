From the neon glow of Hollywood to the sun-drenched boardwalk of Venice Beach, fixed-gear has evolved into a vibrant street culture that is uniquely L.A. From director David Rowe (&quot;Fast Friday&quot;) comes a new documentary feature that explores a side of L.A. few outsiders have seen. From races through rush-hour traffic to midnight loft parties, TO LIVE &amp; RIDE IN L.A. is a fast paced-trip through the busy streets and back-alleys of one of the world's largest cities. TO LIVE &amp; RIDE IN L.A. features talented local riders tearing up the streets with first-time visitor Keo Curry (&quot;Fast Friday&quot;, &quot;Macaframa&quot;) - one of the living legends of the sport. Bike to hidden spots off the map, race a midnight alley-cat, keep pace with the riders from Wolfpack, and hang with the local crews, graffiti artists and other L.A. personalities burning up the fixed-gear scene.\n\nThis file is in Mv4 format and is not my rip.\n\nIt is formatted to 720x480 resoulution\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b68745911171a5a4980c8f1f377bae49fc15a93","amp;dn":"To+Live+and+Ride+in+L.A.+-+Mv4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b68745911171a5a4980c8f1f377bae49fc15a93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,104,116,89,17,23,26,90,73,128,200,241,243,119,186,228,159,193,90,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
