Black Mesa was built and founded on the basis that Half-Life: Source didn't fully live up to the potential of a Source engine port of Half-Life. As such, Black Mesa was founded to fully reconstruct the Half-Life universe utilizing Source to its fullest potential in terms of art detail, level sizes and code features. It should be noted that the project is being built from the ground up and is not a simple port of Half Life maps and models into the Source Engine. The idea is to remake the storyline used in Half Life into a new polished Source Engine version with new models, maps, soundtrack, voice acting and textures.\n\nThe Black Mesa Project\n\nBlack Mesa was started by fans with the goal of remaking the original Half-Life game on the Source engine. The project began in 2004 after it became apparent that Half-Life: Source was not a complete remake but rather an enhanced port of the original game on the Source engine.\nThe team that survives today has been working on the project relentlessly for several years and are determined to see it through to completion.\n\nHistory of the MOD &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://wiki.blackmesasource.com/History_of_the_Mod&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://wiki.blackmesasource.com/History_of_the_Mod&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMORE INFORMATION\n\nGeneral FAQ : &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://wiki.blackmesasource.com/General_FAQ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://wiki.blackmesasource.com/General_FAQ&lt;/a&gt;\nSingle player FAQ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://wiki.blackmesasource.com/Single-player_FAQ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://wiki.blackmesasource.com/Single-player_FAQ&lt;/a&gt;\nDeath Match FAQ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://wiki.blackmesasource.com/Deathmatch_FAQ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://wiki.blackmesasource.com/Deathmatch_FAQ&lt;/a&gt;\nCo-operative FAQ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://wiki.blackmesasource.com/Co-operative_FAQ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://wiki.blackmesasource.com/Co-operative_FAQ&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGameplay Screens:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://release.blackmesasource.com/img/backgrounds/01.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://release.blackmesasource.com/img/backgrounds/01.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://release.blackmesasource.com/img/backgrounds/02.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://release.blackmesasource.com/img/backgrounds/02.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://release.blackmesasource.com/img/backgrounds/03.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://release.blackmesasource.com/img/backgrounds/03.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86a9bf5ee62e8563b03a356a4c25f00d03ac9433","amp;dn":"BLACK+MESA+OFFICIAL+RELEASE+%5BHALF+LIFE+FREE_MOD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86a9bf5ee62e8563b03a356a4c25f00d03ac9433","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,169,191,94,230,46,133,99,176,58,53,106,76,37,240,13,3,172,148,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
