It brings together the most compelling footage from more than 80,000 videos submitted, totalling 4500 hours of content, and combines 331 clips into a 95-minute film crafted by Kevin Macdonald, executive producer Ridley Scott, producer Liza Marshall and their team, in association with YouTube. Contributions poured in from 192 countries from Australia to Zambia, Peru to Ukraine, UK to Japan - from the heart of bustling cities to the furthest and most remote reaches of the earth.
