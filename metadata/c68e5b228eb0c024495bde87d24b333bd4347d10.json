Basically, the concept is to trick large numbers of users\ninto viewing some page through an iframe, and then running code in the\nbackground that tries to DDoS a target site.\n\nRELEASE NOTES\n=========================\nThis is still alpha software. No, seriously. I'm not talking Google's &quot;oh, this might\nbreak once or twice if you use it for years.&quot; No, I mean seriously alpha, as in\nthe bugs you will encounter will probably make you hate me with a passion that burns...\nlike wood...on fire. If it somehow rm -rf / 's your system, I am not responsible.\nHopefully, with your bug reports and some more of my time, it will get more stable.\nUntil then, you have been warned.\n\nDEPENDENCIES\n========================\nMySQL\nPHP w/ mod_rewrite\nA Brain\n\nTODO\n========================\n* Explore more DoS possibilities\n* Explore more methods of maintaining browser control\n* Explore other evil things that could be done with URL shorteners\n\nKNOWN BUGS\n========================\n* Some URLS get mangled by my escaping. I will fix this eventually,\n    but for now it should still work with most.\n\n\nLICENSE\n========================\nThis code is distributed under the GPLv3. See GPL text for more info.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c68e5b228eb0c024495bde87d24b333bd4347d10","amp;dn":"d0z.me+0.2+source+code","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c68e5b228eb0c024495bde87d24b333bd4347d10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,142,91,34,142,176,192,36,73,91,222,135,210,75,51,59,212,52,125,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
