But, he does not charge for this treatment and considers it, as a social service. Surekha (Hemalata Bane)- a Lavani performer, who suffers an injury while dancing, is treated by Namya. She falls in love with him. But Surekha's father puts three conditions in front of Namya to marry his daughter. The first one is to challenge a wrestler from a neighboring village, second one is to get rid of his\nconventional chappals and last and most difficult one is to earn Rs. Three lakhs; so that the father could find replacement for Surekha, to perform at the shows. Namya manages the first one, by curing the wrestler from his back sprain and in return asking him to lose; but he finds it difficult to fulfill the other two conditions.\nDestiny comes to the rescue of Namya and it's 'all is well' at the end. But, 'Lau Ka Lath' being a commercial film, you find the screenplay of the film stuffed with lots of humour filled scenes, involving characters like the frustrated Doctor from the village (Kamlakar Satpute), the demanding father of Surekha and a Shahir (Poet) played by Jaywant Wad, and the two rivals - Sarpanch (Vijay Kadam) and Village Patil (Jairaj Nair), who compete with each other to prove their supremacy. Then, there is also a Police Officer( Pradeep Patwardhan) with his two assistants, a DSP (Rajan Tamhane), a Lady fortune teller (Kishori Ambiye) and dozens of character artistes including former Marathi actress Archana Patkar, who plays the wife of Sarpanch.\n\nMedia Info - \nVideo\nCodec ID/Hint : XviD\nDuration : 2h 3mn\nBit rate : 714 Kbps\nWidth : 576 pixels\nHeight : 288 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 2.000\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\nColor space : YUV\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Progressive\n\nAudio\nCodec ID/Hint : MP3\nDuration : 2h 3mn\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 64.0 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 24.0 KHz\nCompression mode : Lossy\nStream size : 56.1 MiB (8%)\n\nRipper - IndianHacker\n\nSeeding 24x7...
