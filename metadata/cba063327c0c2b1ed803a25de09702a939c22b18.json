Fourth Edition, offers comprehensive coverage of the selection, installation, and safe use of cranes and derricks on construction sites. Written for both engineers and non-engineers by the principals of an engineering consulting firm that has helped to define the state-of-the-art in crane and derrick engineering, this authoritative guide discusses a wide range of equipment and the operations, capabilities, advantages, and disadvantages of each device. References to U.S. and international codes and standards are included in this practical resource, as well as a comprehensive glossary.\n\nCranes and Derricks, Fourth Edition, covers:\n\nLifting equipment theory and fundamentals\nCrane and derrick types and configurations\nMobile crane practices for both crawler and wheel-based cranes\nMultiple crane picks\nInstallation design for tower cranes\nJumping of tower cranes\nChicago boom, guy, gin pole, stiffleg, and other forms of derricks\nLoads acting on cranes and the forces imposed by cranes on their supports\nAnalysis of wind using ASCE-37 and ASCE-7\nStability against overturning\nSafety and risk management\n\nCranes and Derricks has the peculiar role of covering both deep\ntheory and day-to-day practice. There are some portions of the previous\nedition that are arcane, and useful only to a handful of specialists.\nIn the present edition, we have put some of the more abstruse\ntext in appendixes so that it does not deter the typical reader. Other\nportions, particularly in the discussion of derricks, describe practices\nthat are close to obsolescence. There was a temptation to delete this\nmaterial from the present edition, but we kept most of it because it\npresents a way of problem-solving that draws on artful skills and\nimaginative engineering.\nThe authors have been assisted by a coterie of enthusiastic\nreviewers, advisors, and contributors from the crane and construction\nindustries. We limit our explicit acknowledgment to a few who\nmade particularly noteworthy contributions. It was especially gratifying\nto have been mentored by our fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s longtime crane industry\ncolleagues Norman Hargreaves (Terex) and Daniel Quinn (Link Belt);\nthey were persistent sources of assorted help and advice. Mike Quinn\nof Morrow Crane was invaluable in advancing the wind engineering\nportion of Chap. 3. Dominick DÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Antonio and John Kelly of Falcon\nSteel provided astute critiques of several chapters; Stephanie Bass of\nour own office created the new line art. Michael Zhou of Zoomlion\nprovided the list of Chinese crane standards in English translation.\nWe give our heartfelt thanks to the others who gave us assistance\nlarge and small but are not listed here.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cba063327c0c2b1ed803a25de09702a939c22b18","amp;dn":"Cranes+and+Derricks+4th+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cba063327c0c2b1ed803a25de09702a939c22b18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,160,99,50,124,12,43,30,216,3,162,93,224,151,2,169,57,194,43,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
