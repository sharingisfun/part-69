The film creates a new genre of action sports documentation that couples the adventure and excitement of extreme sport with cause-driven initiatives. The expedition provided opportunities to educate the people we encountered about their solar potential. Profits from this film will be donated to the Sun Catchers Project, a non-profit organization that installs solar cooking facilities in African orphanages, hospitals and communities.\nJoin the Africa Revolutions Tour team as they set out on one of the most ambitious kayaking adventures ever! From crocodile infested White Nile in Uganda, big water first descents throughout Madagascar to the highest documented descent of the Zambezi, Africa Revolutions Tour is packed with action! Follow this close group of friends and athletes on their extraordinary adventure.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:284e9d81ace6880d820e85da6b4f1a1b774d24f3","amp;dn":"Africa+Revolutions+Tour+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"284e9d81ace6880d820e85da6b4f1a1b774d24f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,78,157,129,172,230,136,13,130,14,133,218,107,79,26,27,119,77,36,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
