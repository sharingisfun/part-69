This collection includes the cities and countryside in places such as; Italy, France, Germany, Austria, Greece, and many Great Cities in the rest of Europe. The filming was done on helicopter mounted high-definition cameras. The result is some of the most beautiful looks at Europe that can be seen without leaving your home. The aerial views are amazing, giving you glimpses of the popular destinations that cannot be seen from the ground. Whether highlighting the vast untouched natural destinations, such as mountain ranges, lakes, and rivers, or the cities that are mixtures of old and new architecture, the episodes give breathtaking views. Even if you have been to some of the destinations, you will love to see them from the air. It gives the landscape a whole new look.\n\n\n\n\n16)  Wales \nFew places on earth have so long a cultural history and so much dramatic landscape compressed into so few square miles as Wales. A vision of Wales offers breathtaking aerial views of this castle-filled country of contradictions, from the southern tip at Cardiff to the summit of Mount Snowden. From the vantage point of a helicopter-mounted camera, you'll soar over tranquil coastal towns set against bustling cities, farms and pastureland coexisting with the roaring sea, the haunting religious grandeur of Wordsworth's Tintern Abbey, the untouched natural beauty of the River Dee tidal pools, and more - all shrouded in mist, never far removed from either the coastline or the past. Set to traditional music, including the fames Welsh men's choruses, with informative narration about the region's history and culture, Visions of Wales introduces the treasures of Great Britain's western annex, including Chepstow Castle, Swansea, St. David's, and Conwy.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img441/4461/visionsofeuropescreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img441/4461/visionsofeuropescreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img41/16/visionsofeuropescreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img41/16/visionsofeuropescreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img441/7595/visionsofeuropescreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img441/7595/visionsofeuropescreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img43/3527/visionsofeuropescreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img43/3527/visionsofeuropescreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img22/2798/visionsofeuropescreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img22/2798/visionsofeuropescreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img513/1345/visionsofeuropescreen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img513/1345/visionsofeuropescreen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img255/7568/visionsofeuropescreen6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img255/7568/visionsofeuropescreen6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img42/9319/visionsofeuropescreen7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img42/9319/visionsofeuropescreen7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img705/3315/visionsofeuropescreen8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img705/3315/visionsofeuropescreen8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1706\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 56.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 16\n * Part Size: 746 MB\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04348845f936acbf2132e6070e6e3f24601a5b6f","amp;dn":"Visions+of+Europe+16of16+Wales+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04348845f936acbf2132e6070e6e3f24601a5b6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,52,136,69,249,54,172,191,33,50,230,7,14,110,63,36,96,26,91,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
