The show stars Ruth Cracknell, Garry McDonald, Henri Szeps and Judy Morris. It was created and written by Geoffrey Atherden.\n\nArthur Beare is a 40 something son still living at home taking care of his senile mother Maggie. However no matter what he does he cannot seem to get ahead and is always coming unstuck, where Robert cannot put a foot wrong in his mothers eyes, where all he is after is his mothers hidden money\n\nIn my view, one of the finest Australian comedies ever done.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ec71c3a9512c9e9acb0d1acde904fd04d8fe208","amp;dn":"MOTHER_AND_SON_SERIES_2-Episode+1+The+Money.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ec71c3a9512c9e9acb0d1acde904fd04d8fe208","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,199,28,58,149,18,201,233,172,176,209,172,222,144,79,208,77,143,226,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
