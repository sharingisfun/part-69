Took me about 15 minutes to start it up and to run a profile.\n\nCustomizability\nLots of options to choose from, would love an explanation for each option though, but the bot is new so this should come soon. The forums are active and people are eager to help you out. Making your own routes seems simple enough. Rotations are pretty easy to set up, forums also helped with this. Different rotations makes the bot look more human-like.\n\nPlayer Likeness\nUnfortunately the movement of the bot seems quite botlike at the moment, nor does it have any advanced combat, like canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t move out of AoE or melee range skills. I couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get it to run while afk, died a few times during testing, canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t use potions to heal when needed. I think you can add potions to the rotation but you should be able to make it use potions when needed.\n\nRange of Ability You can run simple routes and rotations, loot the mobs you kill but cannot run quests and canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t loot skill nodes. Maybe those things are to come soon, the bot is new.\n\nAbility to run 24/7\nAs i mentioned earlier, I wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t run this while afk. The bot seems to get stuck in some places, you die quite often sometimes and I wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t able to get it to run in the background.\n\nDifficulty of advanced setup\nReally not that hard. As i mentioned already, the forums help with most of the issues you might run in to. With the features it right now has it isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t that complicated.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01fccb2780894a252402bb42aeb6a9534cee3996","amp;dn":"Astral+Neverwinter+Bot+Elite+%5BCracked%5D+%5BarMa%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01fccb2780894a252402bb42aeb6a9534cee3996","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,252,203,39,128,137,74,37,36,2,187,66,174,182,169,83,76,238,57,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
