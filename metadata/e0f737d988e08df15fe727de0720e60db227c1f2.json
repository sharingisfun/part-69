Machin is best known as the vocalist on the hit song, &quot;El Manisero (The Peanut Vendor),&quot; though he is also one of the all-time finest Cuban bolero singers. Several excellent retrospectives of his work, covering various phases of career have come out recently on the Tumbao, Harlequin and Caney labels.\n\nAfter the success of El Manisero, Machin released a spate of recordings in New York between 1930 and 1935. During this period he waxed some 200 sides, recording even more than American pop star Bing Crosby. Machin did much of his work in a small-group format, favoring quartets comprised of claves, tres, guitar, and trumpet. While the personnel for these quartets varied, Machin was most often accompanied by guitarist Daniel Sanchez, who sings duets with him on the vast majority of these recordings. Sanchez has a pleasant baritone that contrasts with MachÃƒÂ­n's tenor, but there's no indication on any recording that he's Machin's equal as a vocalist. Best-known of all the quartet personnel is Mario Bauza, who would later become the Machito orchestra's musical director. Bauza plays trumpet on some of the quartet sessions... Still, Machin's place in Cuban -- and American -- musical history is secure, and justifiably so. When he's at his best, Machin's coloratura can send a chill up your spine. -Biography by Spencer Harrington (Allmusic)\n\n01. Entre Tinieblas\n02. Don Lengua\n03. Mujer\n04. Caramelero\n05.
