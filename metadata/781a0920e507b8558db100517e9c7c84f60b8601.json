The military has evacuated the city and locked it down. Even so, disturbing rumors and images seep out, finding their way onto the Internet, spreading curiosity, skepticism, and panic. For what they show isÃ¢â‚¬â€or should beÃ¢â‚¬â€impossible: strange creatures that cannot exist, sudden disappearances that violate the laws of physics, human bodies fused with inanimate objects, trapped yet still half alive. . . .\n \nDean Walker, an aspiring photographer, sneaks into the quarantined city in search of fame. What he finds will change him in unimaginable ways. Hooking up with a group of outcasts led by a beautiful young woman named Taylor, Dean embarks on a journey into the heart of a mystery whose philosophical implications are as terrifying as its physical manifestations. Even as he falls in love with TaylorÃ¢â‚¬â€a woman as damaged and seductive as the city itselfÃ¢â‚¬â€his already tenuous hold on reality starts to come loose. Or perhaps it is SpokaneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s grip on the world that is coming undone.\n \nNow, caught up in a web of interlacing secrets and betrayals, Dean, Taylor, and their friends must make their way through this ever-shifting maze of a city, a city that is actively hunting them down, herding them toward a shocking destiny.\n\n\n                              Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                              Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n\n             **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n               Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                     &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:781a0920e507b8558db100517e9c7c84f60b8601","amp;dn":"Bad+Glass+by+Richard+E.+Gropp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"781a0920e507b8558db100517e9c7c84f60b8601","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,26,9,32,229,7,184,85,141,177,0,81,126,156,124,132,246,11,134,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
