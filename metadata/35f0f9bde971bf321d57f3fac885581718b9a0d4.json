TV newswoman, Karen White, goes on a retreat after a traumatic incident with a serial killer. But is she really safe? And what should she fear more: regaining her memory or the creepy residents of &quot;The Colony&quot;? Followed by many unsatisfying and unconnected sequels. Helped launch shortlived werewolf craze in early eighties. \n\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082533/\n\nScreen samples: in comments below\n\n\n\nPLEASE SEED AND SHARE","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35f0f9bde971bf321d57f3fac885581718b9a0d4","amp;dn":"The+Howling.+1981+720p+.BRRip.H264.ME2108","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35f0f9bde971bf321d57f3fac885581718b9a0d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,240,249,189,233,113,191,50,29,87,243,250,200,133,88,23,24,185,160,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
