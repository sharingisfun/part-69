So whenever you unlock your device, you are presented with the Home Screen that is immediately valuable to you. Chameleon Home Screens can be set up based on GPS locations, WiFi networks and time ranges, allowing you to define which Home Screen is the most relevant for the situation.\n\nWhat's in this version:\nFixed the Ã¢â‚¬Å“blank widgetÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ problem. (For real this time [we think...]).\nDeactivated Dashboard Sleeping. (Needs a bit more work). They will appear as sleeping at startup, though.\n7Ã¢â‚¬Â³ Tablets can now have 5 Dashboards. 10Ã¢â‚¬Â³ are limited to 4.\n\n                                By bobiras2009\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f531270a5af4eb2dcf4bcbc2ff689645f976017","amp;dn":"Chameleon+Launcher%5BPreOrder%5D+v1.0.0+By+bobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f531270a5af4eb2dcf4bcbc2ff689645f976017","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,83,18,112,165,175,78,178,220,244,188,188,47,246,137,100,95,151,96,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
