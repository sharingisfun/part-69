So, Carol turns her beloved garden into a living laboratory and plays host to scientific experts who help her to explore, analyse and observe her soil, compost, seeds, weather, leaves, and flowers.\n\nCarol asks the questions to which many gardeners want answers: Why don't my seeds germinate? How does compost work? What is photosynthesis and why is it important? What happens when we prune a plant? How do insects see flowers? And how can I work out which plants should go where in my garden?\n\nCarol shows that by understanding the science behind gardening, we can all become better gardeners and grow more beautiful and more bountiful gardens.\n\nDuration: 1 hour","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:838c40294414987c10e78cc3058085c8fb57e28e","amp;dn":"Gardeners+World+-+The+Science+of+Gardening+%28AVI%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"838c40294414987c10e78cc3058085c8fb57e28e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,140,64,41,68,20,152,124,16,231,140,195,5,128,133,200,251,87,226,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
