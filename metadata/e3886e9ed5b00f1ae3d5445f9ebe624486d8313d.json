C. Thomson &amp; Co. Ltd\nBy Alan Hebeden\nCover artwork by Janek Matysiak\n\nIn 1941, the Luftwaffe's sleek and deadly Focke-Wulf 190 appeared from nowhere to terrorise the RAF. Even their best fighter, the Supermarine Spitfire MkV, was no match for it. The British needed an intact Fw190 to discover its weaknessesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and a way to defeat it.\n\nThe top brass came up with a simple but dangerous plan. A crack Commando squad would lead a raid to steal a Focke-Wulf from right under the Jerries' noses! All they needed was a pilot.\n\nThat's when Flight Lieutenant Tam McDermott stepped up. Fluent in German and with a working knowledge of Luftwaffe aircraft, he was perfect - if only he could survive his Commando training!\n\n\nCommando #4544 - The Sorcerer's Apprentice\nPublisher:  D. C. Thomson &amp; Co. Ltd\nBy Alan Hebeden\nCover artwork by Keith Page\n\nPrivate Frankie Horton was far from the best soldier ever to serve in the Eighth Army. His rifle was likely to be the dirtiest and his uniform the scruffiest in his squad. He also had a tendency to dream, particularly about being a magician - an ambition he had had since childhood.\n\nNo-one would have believed it if they were told that, thanks to Frankie, an almost certain German victory in North Africa would be averted.\n\nNot even Frankie. And he believed in magic.\n\n\nCommando #4546 - A Touch of Courage\nPublisher:  D. C. Thomson &amp; Co. Ltd\nBy Cyril Walker\nCovert artwork by Jeff Bevan\n\nDo you believe in magic? No? Well, Englishman Sam Benson wasn't too sure either. While out in Australia he saw an aboriginal ceremony where the natives touched a totem believing it would give them courage.\n\nLittle did he know that several months later, while fighting the Japanese on the far-off island of Ketta, that same ritual would save his life!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3886e9ed5b00f1ae3d5445f9ebe624486d8313d","amp;dn":"Commando+%234543-4545","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3886e9ed5b00f1ae3d5445f9ebe624486d8313d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,136,110,158,213,176,15,26,227,213,68,95,158,190,98,68,134,216,49,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
