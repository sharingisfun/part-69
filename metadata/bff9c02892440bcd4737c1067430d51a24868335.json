So we invented LocaleÃ‚Â®!\nLocale's advanced artificial intelligence manages settings automatically. For example: arrive at work and instantly your ringer silences, your wallpaper snaps to that scenic Caribbean photo, and Wi-Fi switches on. With Locale, never worry about your ringer going off accidentally again. Once you experience Locale's power and convenience, you'll never want to be without it. Set it and forget it!\n\nLOCATION\nLocale leverages patent pending artificial intelligence geofencing algorithms to combine accelerometer, cell, Wi-Fi, GPS, and other signals for instant location detection.\nConfiguring is simpleÃ¢â‚¬â€it just works! To create a geofence location, drag and drop the pin on the map, resize the radius using your finger, and Locale does the rest.\nThe best part? No huge battery drains because Locale typically uses 3% or less of the battery. During our extensive testing across twenty popular Android devices, we found the battery lasts several days with Locale running.\n\nPLUG-INS\nLocale manages more than your ringer. Along with built-in conditions (Battery, Calendar (Android 4.0+), Caller, Location, Orientation, Time) and built-in settings (Bluetooth, Display Brightness, Display Timeout, Ringtone, Volume, Media Volume, Shortcut, Wallpaper, Wi-Fi), Locale expands with an advanced plug-in architecture. Over 400 Locale plug-ins exist on Google Play.\nImagine increasing your productivity by combining Locale with AstridÃ¢â‚¬â€an amazing task and todo management appÃ¢â‚¬â€for location-aware reminders.
