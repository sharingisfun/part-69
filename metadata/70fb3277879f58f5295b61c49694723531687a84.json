If you play this on a big screen, it will not look fantastic, but it is Jeopardy! The original HD files are too big for me to seed on my bandwidth. \n\nI've noticed there is someone else who uploads Jeopardy for the week at the end of the week. I'm not trying to pull the rug out from under them -- I'm just trying to help!\n\nAs Jeopardy! is not in syndication anywhere online, I have included the original commercials intact. I encourage you to watch them and support Jeopardy! sponsors.\n\nCOMMENTS ON QUALITY ARE APPRECIATED!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70fb3277879f58f5295b61c49694723531687a84","amp;dn":"Jeopardy+%5BHD%5D+02.NOV.2011+in+MP4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70fb3277879f58f5295b61c49694723531687a84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,251,50,119,135,159,88,245,41,91,97,196,150,148,114,53,49,104,122,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
