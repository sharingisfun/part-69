Each entry deals with one fallacy, explaining what the fallacy is, giving and analysing an example, outlining when/where/why the particular fallacy tends to occur and finally showing how you can perpetrate the fallacy on other people in order to win an argument. Originally published to great acclaim in 1985 as &quot;The Book of Fallacy&quot;, this is a classic brought up-to-date for a whole new generation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38deecb742a832bd7c8b7edbfdffcb3820c6831d","amp;dn":"How+to+Win+Every+Argument.by.Madsen.Pirie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38deecb742a832bd7c8b7edbfdffcb3820c6831d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,222,236,183,66,168,50,189,124,139,126,219,253,255,203,56,32,198,131,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
