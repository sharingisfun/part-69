Now, one has only to look at Bush v. Gore, Citizens United, and the Affordable Care Act rulings to understand why some call it a Ã¢â‚¬Å“one-percent CourtÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€ dedicated by majority rule to preserving the power and influence of a minority of wealthy special interests.\n\nIn this episode, The Nation editor Katrina vanden Heuvel and Jamie Raskin, constitutional law professor and Maryland state senator, join Bill to discuss how the uncontested power of the Supreme Court is changing our elections, our country, and our lives. The two joined forces for a special upcoming issue of The Nation entitled Ã¢â‚¬Å“The One Percent Court.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“We wanted to bring attention to how this court has empowered the 1% at the expense of the 99%,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ says vanden Heuvel. Ã¢â‚¬Å“How it is now working for big business, for corporate power against the interests of ordinary citizens in this country.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nAlso on the program, Bill talks with Craig Unger, author of Boss Rove: Inside Karl RoveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Secret Kingdom of Power, about RoveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s behind-the-scenes maneuvering to once again affect the outcome of a presidential election.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Most people thought he was a creature of the Bush family,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Unger tells Bill. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I think heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a force more powerful than that.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10818e777d396c6c0e70917c606ef5d79e4930e4","amp;dn":"The+One+Percent+Court-+Moyers+and+Company+-+091412-avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10818e777d396c6c0e70917c606ef5d79e4930e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,129,142,119,125,57,108,108,14,112,145,124,96,110,245,215,158,73,48,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
