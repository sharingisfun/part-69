Equally skilled in the arts of torture, the film becomes a ridiculously enjoyable battle of the sexes, where the sexual tension between the two of them are resolved. Imagine Jason and Freddy flirting, or Godzilla holding a flame for Mothra. Enter JuliaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s competitive sister Jessica, a house with a past, and lots of dating site cliches used as threats, and you have an incredibly comic, brutal battle royale. \n\nGenre: Thriller \nIMDB rating: 5.3/10 \nDirected by: P.J.
