This collection of heavy songs from the style's ''golden era'' in the years surrounding WWII includes many of the ''heavy-hitters,'' great and revered singers and composers, but also includes many obscure artists, including several from the influential American diaspora. For fans of the style, if offers brilliant lesser-known pieces and for the uninitiated, it cuts to the heart of rembetikaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s swagger, grief, and fierce beauty.\n\nGreek Rembetika is subject to another cracking Mississippi compilation on the fantastically titled 'Bed Of Pain' LP. Extracted exclusively from vintage 78s previously unissued on LP, it's a beautifully dark and vividly evocative selection of lesser known yet instantly affective songs about love, crime, death, drugs and the vices of the early 20th century Greek diaspora. They were all sourced from the collections of Hellenians living in the U.S. who were part of the nation's displaced and emigrated population, and hark back to a time when the country was much maligned by imperial control, whether it be English, German, or Ottoman. These are the voices and bouzoukis of the underclass; a hash-stoned syncretic folk and pop music fusing a range of Asia-minor styles whose provenance is as murky as the mud and slums where they were born. While the label pay deference to Charles Howard's many more definitive collections - the 'Mortika - Recordings From A Greek Underworld' LP is particularly stunning - these songs are certainly still worthy of your attention. We may not be able to understand the lyrics but the heart-aching intonation of 'The Offenders' by Nikos Pourpourakis, Kostas Roukounas' sozzled lament 'Ouzo Ouzo', and Kostas Skarvelis' 'Pain Without Pity' all carry their impassioned messages clear and true.
