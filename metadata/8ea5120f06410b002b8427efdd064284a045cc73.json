L.A. private eye Mick St. John (Alex O'Loughlin) has a secret of his own. He's a vampire, dwelling in a covert netherworld complicated by friendship with an undead finance honcho (Jason Dohring), memories of the alluring ex- wife (Shannyn Sossamon) who turned him into a vampire, and a relationship with a human (Sophia Myles) he feels drawn to protect - and maybe to love. But no matter how tempting, Mick knows a vampire-human romance is eternally dangerous. This 16-episode, 4-disc set of the series voted the 2008 People's Choice Award for Favorite New TV Drama is a sure entertainment bet for all who like their vampire stories sleek, intense and passionate.\n\nSource: DVD9 R1\nVideo:  NTSC Untouched\nAspect Ratio: 16:9\nAudio: English Dolby Digital 5.1\nSubtitles: English, French, Spanish, Thai\nMenu: Yes\nScene Selection: No\nSpecial Features: No\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ea5120f06410b002b8427efdd064284a045cc73","amp;dn":"Moonlight+-+The+Complete+Series+NTSC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ea5120f06410b002b8427efdd064284a045cc73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,165,18,15,6,65,11,0,43,132,39,239,221,6,66,132,160,69,204,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
