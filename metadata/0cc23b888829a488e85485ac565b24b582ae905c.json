First aired and captured in H264 AVCHD at 8,000 kbps from the 16:9 widescreen \n1920 x 1080i HD source on 09/21/2012 on the SyFy HD channel on DirecTv HDTV Digital Satellite then converted to 16:9 widescreen 1280 x 720p resolution Framerate is 59.940 with an average Video Bitrate of 5,000 kbps in a High Quality 2.73 GB 720p H264 AVCHD Blu-Ray MKV release with 48khz 384 kbps AAC 2 channel stereo audio show runtime 1 Hour 24 minutes 30 seconds\n\nThis is my 76th official 720p H264 AVCHD-SC-SDH release. Enjoy the show WWE Friday Night Smackdown wrestling fans. \n\n\nFor the few people out there who seem to think my 720p HD releases have too much color I have completely checked and rechecked all the settings on my HDTV and satellite equipment and my HD capture card here and the video looks fine here on my equipment and the color is perfectly fine here, so I don't know what to say at this point. I have made an adjustment in my capture card settings from the default color setting of 115 down to 85 which is a difference of 30 which I used for the last 4 releases from WWE Friday Night Smackdown 2012-09-14 720p AVCHD-SC-SDH - Sons Of Anarchy HDTV S05E02 720p AVCHD-SC-SDH. Starting with this TNA Impact show I have further reduced the color saturation setting from 85 down to 64. If this isn't good enough for you people who think there is too much color then I am sorry but I will not go any lower on the settings then this because like I have said earlier the video looks perfectly fine here captured at the default setting of 115 on my capture card played back on my expensive state of the art 55 inch LG LED 3D Smart HDTV equipment without any of above adjustments. I even have a friend of mine who is a professional broadcast engineer at a CBS HDTV station who says there is nothing wrong with my captures and he would know better then I do as he is the one who helped me get the proper equipment setup here to do the shows I do.\n\n\nMy releases are in MP4 format with AAC 2 channel stereo audio instead of the MKV format with 5.1 channel AC3 Dolby Digital audio I was doing them in previously so that they are playable with VLC player as well as Media Player Classic, Windows Media Player, iPhone, iPad, Sony Playstation 3, Xbox 360, Samsung Galaxy S III smartphones, and any other devices capable of playing 720p HD MP4 video files.\n\n\nEnjoy the WWE Friday Night Smackdown show wrestling fans and thanks for downloading my WWE Friday Night Smackdown HDTV 2012-09-21 720p AVCHD-SC-SDH release. Enjoy the show!!!\n\nUploaded by SCSA420 on ThePirateBay.se and KickAss Torrents\n\nStoneCold420 \nSmackDownHotel\nSeptember 21, 2012\n\n\nFor 2012 SDH releases from 2012-03-29 onward please check here:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/SCSA420&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/SCSA420&lt;/a&gt;  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0cc23b888829a488e85485ac565b24b582ae905c","amp;dn":"WWE+Friday+Night+Smackdown+HDTV+2012-09-21+720p+AVCHD-SC-SDH","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0cc23b888829a488e85485ac565b24b582ae905c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,194,59,136,136,41,164,136,232,84,133,172,86,91,36,181,130,174,144,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
