Newly rewritten by Gaiman for this graphic novel, these two ominous stories from the authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s award-winning prose, Smoke and Mirrors: Short Fictions and Illusions, feature animals and people not being quite what they seem. In The Price, a black cat like a small panther arrives at a country home and is soon beset by mysterious and vicious wounds. What is he fighting every night that could do this, and why does he persist? The Daughter of Owls recounts an eerie old tale of a foundling girl who was left with an owl pellet as a newborn on the steps of the Dymton Church. She was soon cloistered away in a local convent, but by her fourteenth year word of her beauty had spreadÃ¢â‚¬â€and those who would prey upon her faced unforeseen consequences.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f43e5df013e1f5868bbb29630f927211087d3f95","amp;dn":"Creatures+of+the+Night+%282004%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f43e5df013e1f5868bbb29630f927211087d3f95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,62,93,240,19,225,245,134,139,187,41,99,15,146,114,17,8,125,63,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
