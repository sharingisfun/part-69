I don't have the full version and I'm not going to upload it, so don't ask for it please. \n\n\nAlso, the game is in Japanese, so if the trial refuses to work use Applocale or change your system locale to Japanese. If you don't know how to do that, Google is your friend.\n\nThis trial is also freely available from the developers' website free of charge: http://www.zyx-game.co.jp/newsoft/raidy3/index.html\n\nHowever, downloading an 1.8 GB file with direct download can be problematic for people with slow and/or unreliable net connection. That's why I've created this torrent.\n\nMy upload speed isn't the best either, but I'll seed this until the end of the year at least. Please, help me seed once you've finished downloading.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d1acf48a21f29012eff43cb9768d1f797e69b85","amp;dn":"%5BZyX%5D+Ikazuchi+no+Senshi+Raidi+3+%7EGyakushuu+no+Jashinkan%7E+Trial+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d1acf48a21f29012eff43cb9768d1f797e69b85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,26,207,72,162,31,41,1,46,255,67,203,151,104,209,247,151,230,155,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
