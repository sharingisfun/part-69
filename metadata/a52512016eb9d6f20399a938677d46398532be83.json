I simply imported them into Element 3D, applied all the diffuse, specular and bump maps, and saved them. Figured this would save people some time. I got sick of having to remap all my models every time I downloaded a new one.\n\n\nThanks,\n\nDX123","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a52512016eb9d6f20399a938677d46398532be83","amp;dn":"aircraft","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a52512016eb9d6f20399a938677d46398532be83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,37,18,1,110,185,214,242,3,153,169,56,103,125,70,57,133,50,190,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
