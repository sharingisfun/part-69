EXPECT US!      #\n################################################################################\n    \nThe IACP thought they could hold their 2011 annual conference in Chicago\nunfettered by the clutches of insurrection. They must not have known their\nconference starts on the Day of Action Against Police Brutality. They must not\nhave known that all over the world people are in the streets demonstrating\ndiscontent with capitalism and the state. They also had no idea that for the\npast few months black hat hackers have been owning their websites and databases.\nThey should have expected us.\n\nIn solidarity with the Occupation Movement and the International Day of Action\nAgainst Police Brutality, allied #anonymous and #antisec vessels took aim at the\ncorrupt bootboys of the 1%: the police. We hacked, defaced, and destroyed\nseveral law enforcement targets, leaking over 600MB of private information\nincluding internal documents, membership rosters, addresses, passwords, social\nsecurity numbers, and other confidential data. According to the IACP\\\\\\'s\ndevelopment documents, their systems cost several hundred thousand dollars. We\nare pleased to destroy it all for free, leaking their private info and defacing\ntheir websites in one swift blow.\n\nWe attacked MatrixGroup.net, a multi-million dollar Washington DC based web\ndevelopment firm, which serves over a hundred government, corporate and\nassociation websites. Many lulz have been had as we owned their white hat\n\\\\\\&quot;professional\\\\\\&quot; intranet, clients and employee wiki portals-- accessing records\nand passwords, internal communications, company schedules, and development notes\nfor over a hundred clients. We intentionally excluded the unions and other\nunrelated sites on their servers because, unlike the police and those who\nsupport them, we will never betray our working class comrades. We realize our\nrole in the social struggle against capital and against the state, deciding\ninstead to set our sights on the police, military and other government websites\nhosted by Matrix.\n \nOur lulzboats also took aim at Boston Police in retaliation for the unprovoked\nmass arrests and brutality experienced by those at Occupy Boston. We hacked the\nBoston Police Patrolmens\\\\\\' Association (www.bppa.org), releasing full names and\nthe cleartext, user-supplied passwords for a thousand members. Many lulz have\nbeen had while perusing their emails and facebook accounts, and we are now\nsharing their passwords for others so they can join in on the mayhem as well.\nLet this be a warning to BPD and police everywhere: future acts of aggression\nagainst our movements will be met with a vengeance so epic and relentless that\nyour children\\\\\\'s children will puke at the sight of swine.\n\nAfter exhausting both sides of Milli Vanillis\\\\\\' \\\\\\&quot;Girl You Know It\\\\\\'s True\\\\\\&quot; tape,\nwe also decided to attack Alabama law enforcement systems, releasing the names,\naddresses, and social security numbers for 1000 Birmingham / Jefferson County\npolice officers as well as defacing and destroying the website\nSherrifOfBaldwin.com. We are attacking Birmingham specifically because of their\nnotorious racial discriminatory practices including the savage beatings and mass\narrests endured by civil rights protesters during the 60s. Although we had\nrecords of inmates, active warrant names, addresses, charges and social security\nnumbers the thought of releasing them never crossed our mind because we would\nnever betray our brothers and sisters shackled and chained behind prison walls--\nour targets are the ones who beat and murder with immunity, the cowardly\ncarcases and lifeless hosts of power who hide behind a badge. \n\nWe are also acting in solidarity with the dozens of alleged \\\\\\&quot;Anonymous\\\\\\&quot; members\naround the world facing charges for \\\\\\&quot;hacking,\\\\\\&quot; including the Paypal LOIC\ndefendants in San Jose, Commander X, Recursion, Topiary, Stephen Watt, and more.\nWe are acting in solidarity with the thousands of prisoners in California on\nHunger Strike fighting for better living conditions and an end to prolonged\nsolitary confinement. We also call for the IMMEDIATE RELEASE of not only\npolitical prisoners(Leonard Peltier, Mumia Abu Jamal, the MOVE 9, the Angola 3,\nand more) but all prisoners everywhere including all Jon Burge torture survivors\nstill behind bars.\n\nWe are attacking the police because they are the vicious boot boys of the 1%\nwhose role in society is to protect the interests and assets of the rich ruling\nclass. They are not part of the 99%-- they are working class traitors who are\npaid to intimidate, harass, and repress political movements that would possibly\nstand a threat to the power structure of the 1%. We have no problem targeting\npolice and releasing their information even if it puts them at risk because we\nwant them to experience just a taste of the brutality and misery they serve us\non an everyday basis. We hope those working for the police who have any humanity\nleft refuse their orders and leak the police and their commanding officer\\\\\\'s\nvital secrets and dirt. We must realize that police are no allies of ours and\nhave violently attacked our movements all across the world throughout history.\n\nIn Chicago, where the International Association of Chiefs of Police conference\nis taking place, the CPD has a particularly bloody and ruthless history of\nbrutality and repression of political movements. Throughout the 70s and 80s\nunder Jon Burge (chief detective) and former Mayor Richard M. Daley (prosecuter\nat the time), dozens of CPD detectives many whom are still on the force tortured\nhundreds of innocent black men, forcing confessions and giving out decades-long\nprison sentences for crimes never committed. The CPD also operates notorious\n\\\\\\&quot;red squad\\\\\\&quot; COINTELPRO operations that attempts to discredit and disrupt\nrevolutionary groups-- including the assassination of Black Panther Party\nleaders Fred Hampton and Mark Clark. This repression continues today as they\nbeat and arrested over 900 protesters when the second War in Iraq broke out, and\njust over a year ago dozens of protest organizers were raided by the FBI for\nalleged affiliation with resistance movements. The CPD just announced a new\n\\\\\\'counter-terrorism\\\\\\' operation (taking tips from the NYPD playbook) likely to\ntarget protest organizers for the upcoming G8 and NATO conferences in May.\nAlthough they try to intimidate us by training over 13,000 riot police for these\nprotests, we believe that they are the truly the frightened ones, and perhaps\nfor good reason: the high profile hacks will continue, and the protests against\nthe 1% are growing every day.\n\nWe are 99%. We are the working class that makes society function. We are not\nintimidated by the States attempts to disrupt our resistance through unprovoked\narrests and harassments. As the violence of the cops, the courts, the FBI, La\nMigra, and Homeland Security intensifies, so must our resistance: we will\ncontinue to bring the ruckus on the streets and on the internet. We are\nbelievers and practitioners of direct action against all governments,\nmilitaries, banks, corporations, and police working towards our revolutionary\ngoal: the immediate dissolution of capitalism and the state.\n\nHackers, join us to make 2011 the year of leaks and revolutions!\n\n\\\\\\&quot;We will destroy laughing, we will set fires laughing, we will kill laughing...\nand society will fall!!\\\\\\&quot; - Renzo Novatore\n\n################################################################################\n### OWN &amp; RM ### OWN &amp; RM ### OWN &amp; RM ### OWN &amp; RM ### OWN &amp; RM ### OWN &amp; RM ##\n################################################################################\n\n  [*] INTERNATIONAL CHIEF OF POLICE TARGETS:\n      * IACP membership rosters (16,000 names, addresses, member numbers, \n      phone numbers, etc)\n      * Databases for all IACP related websites including login/password info\n      * DISCOVERPOLICECAREERS.ORG Interal Documents (250MB of PDFs, DOCs)\n      * POLICEVOLUNTEER.ORG Private Email List 2005-2011 and 340MB of Documents\n\n  [*] BOSTON POLICE PATROLMENS\\\\\\' ASSOCIATION:\n      1000 full names and cleartext user-supplied passwords.\n      \n  [*] ALABAMA POLICE TARGETS:\n      1000 names, ranks, addresses, phone numbers, and social security numbers\n      for police officers in Birmingham / Jefferson County area, as well as\n      names and passwords associated with SheriffOfBaldwin.com website\n      \n  [*] MATRIX GROUP:\n      Full contact database including names, addresses, passwords for hundreds\n      of employees and clients, and internal development notes for intranet and\n      clients portals\n   \n################################################################################\n### IACP ### OWNED ### IACP ### OWNED #### IACP ### OWNED ### IACP ### OWNED ###\n################################################################################\n\nCAREERSINPOLICING.COM, CAREERSINPOLICING.ORG, DECP.ORG,\nDISCOVERLAWENFORCEMENT.NET,\nDISCOVERLAWENFORCEMENT.ORG, DISCOVERPOLICE.COM, DISCOVERPOLICE.NET,\nDISCOVERPOLICE.ORG, DISCOVERPOLICECAREERS.COM, DISCOVERPOLICECAREERS.ORG,\nDISCOVERPOLICING.COM, DISCOVERPOLICING.NET, DISCOVERPOLICING.ORG,\nIACP-JOYCE.ORG, IACPRESEARCH.ORG, IACPSOCIALMEDIA.ORG, IACPTRAINING.COM,\nIACPTRAINING.ORG, IDSAFETY.COM, IDSAFETY.ORG, LAWENFORCEMENTCAREERS.ORG,\nLAWENFORCEMENTCHALLENGE.ORG, PATROLVEHICLESAFETY.ORG, POLICECHIEFMAGAZINE.COM,\nPOLICECHIEFMAGAZINE.NET, POLICECHIEFMAGAZINE.ORG, POLICECHIEFONLINE.COM,\nPOLICECHIEFONLINE.NET, POLICECHIEFONLINE.ORG, POLICEVOLUNTEER.COM,\nPOLICEVOLUNTEER.ORG, POLICEVOLUNTEERS.COM, POLICEVOLUNTEERS.ORG, PSLC-IACP.ORG,\nRESPONSETOVICTIMS.COM, RESPONSETOVICTIMS.INFO, RESPONSETOVICTIMS.NET,\nRESPONSETOVICTIMS.ORG, VOLUNTEERINPOLICESERVICE.ORG,\nVOLUNTEERSINPOLICESERVICE.ORG           40 police domains wiped off the internet\n\n################################################################################\n\n      (read full release text and hacklog at http://pastebin.com/aFe0eVsU )","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdd00a7a7ff131a41f553a6f437e767e60ec2a6a","amp;dn":"International+Association+of+Chiefs+of+Police+Owned","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdd00a7a7ff131a41f553a6f437e767e60ec2a6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,208,10,122,127,241,49,164,31,85,58,111,67,126,118,126,96,236,42,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
