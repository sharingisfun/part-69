Did NASA rovers Spirit and Opportunity find the answers when they touched down on Mars in 2004?Are dust devils the reason for Mars condition long time periods.\nAlthough we have extreme weather on earth, it is nothing in comparison to the wettest, dustiest and most brutal 'Alien Storms.' \n\nRadical weather is not uncommon in the solar system and storms on other planets are bigger, more powerful and stranger than their counter-parts on earth. This programme is an in-depth investigation into the source of such dramatic weather in the solar system and why it is so different from the weather we experience on earth. \n\nWatch how once the incredible dust storms on Mars have started, it can take months for the skies to clear and learn how Neptune's extreme winds can reach speeds of 2,500 an kilometres an hour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNarrated by: Phil Crowley\n===========================\n\n\n\nWritten &amp; Directed by: Sean Dash\n================================\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................:    Alien Storms\nYear.................:    2011\nGenre................:    Documentary \nVideo Length.........:    00:44:34\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........:    192 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........:    (AC3) \nLanguage.............:    English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.:    16/9 \n\nVideo Codec..........:    XviD \nVideo Resolution.....:    640x480\nVIdeo Bitrate........:    2375 kbit/s\n\n\nSubs.................:    (N/A) \nFile Size:...........:    757 MB\nFPS..................:    29.970000\n\nChannel(s)...........:    2 channels\nRelease date.........:    2011\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit\\&quot; Suprbay Forum\\&quot; at \nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the \\&quot;nfo\\&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                     ***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD *****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1612920f82ae2761b23e0b7941c64a33ab910296","amp;dn":"Aliens+Storms-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1612920f82ae2761b23e0b7941c64a33ab910296","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,18,146,15,130,174,39,97,178,62,11,121,65,198,74,51,171,145,2,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
