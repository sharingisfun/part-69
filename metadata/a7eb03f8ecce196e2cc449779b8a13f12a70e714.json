(2012)\n\n\nAerosmith were one of the most popular hard rock bands of the '70s, setting the style and sound of hard rock and heavy metal for the next two decades with their raunchy, bluesy swagger. The Boston-based quintet found the middle ground between the menace of the Rolling Stones and the campy, sleazy flamboyance of the New York Dolls, developing a lean, dirty riff-oriented boogie that was loose and swinging and as hard as a diamond. \n\nMusic from Another Dimension! is the upcoming 15th studio album by American rock band Aerosmith, to be released on November 6, 2012 by Columbia Records. This will be their first studio album since 2004's Honkin' on Bobo and the first to feature all-new material since 2001's Just Push Play, marking the longest gap between Aerosmith's studio albums. This album will be released in a single CD edition, along with a deluxe version. It is the last album in Aerosmith's current recording contract with Sony/Columbia Records and was produced by Jack Douglas, Steven Tyler, Joe Perry and Marti Frederiksen (3 tracks). The album includes the singles &quot;Legendary Child&quot;, &quot;Lover Alot&quot; and &quot;What Could Have Been Love&quot;.\n\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFLAC Lossless\nLabel:\t\t\tColumbia\nCatalog:\t\t88725442812\nAudiochecker:\t\t99.87% CDDA \nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.LUV XXX\n02.Oh Yeah\n03.Beautiful\n04.Tell Me\n05.Out Go The Lights\n06.Legendary Child\n07.What Could Have Been Love\n08.Street Jesus\n09.Can't Stop Lovin' You (Feat.
