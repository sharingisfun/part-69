Fortress of the Bears in Southeast Alaska harbors the largest concentration of Alaskan Brown bears on Earth. Some 1,800 brown bears inhabit its twisted and folded terrain. When the salmon, the bears' main food source, do not return for the first time one summer, the grizzlies must find something else to eat from grass to even Dungeness crabs. The Fortress is no longer secure.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8965015cb2d0870e973b9a2764391dbac97c34b2","amp;dn":"Bears+of+Fear+Island+2011+1080i+HDTV+H.264+MP2.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8965015cb2d0870e973b9a2764391dbac97c34b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,101,1,92,178,208,135,14,151,59,154,39,100,57,29,186,201,124,52,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
