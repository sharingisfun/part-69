Chrono Trigger's development team included three designers that Square dubbed the &quot;Dream Team&quot;: Hironobu Sakaguchi, the creator of Square's Final Fantasy series; Yuji Horii, a freelance designer and creator of Enix's popular Dragon Quest series; and Akira Toriyama, a freelance manga artist famed for his work with Dragon Quest and Dragon Ball. Kazuhiko Aoki produced the game, Masato Kato wrote most of the plot, Hiroyuki Ito was the game designer as well as animator, while composer Yasunori Mitsuda scored most of the game before falling ill and deferring remaining tracks to Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu. The game's story follows a group of adventurers who travel through time to prevent a global catastrophe.\n\nChrono Trigger was a critical and commercial success. It is now considered to be one of the greatest video games of all time. Nintendo Power magazine described aspects of Chrono Trigger as revolutionary, including its multiple endings, plot-related sidequests focusing on character development, unique battle system, and detailed graphics. Chrono Trigger was the third best-selling game of 1995, and the game's SNES and PlayStation iterations have shipped 2.65 million copies as of March 2003. The version for the Nintendo DS sold 790,000 copies as of March 2009. Chrono Trigger was also ported to mobile phones, Virtual Console, the PlayStation Network, iOS devices, and Android devices.\n\n\nThis release includes the official game PKG, as well as the fix. Tested and works great on Rogero's 4.21 CFW. Should also work fine on 3.55.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Install Chrono Trigger.pkg (if you're on 4.21 the PKG will be copied to the internal HDD first and you can install it from there like a purchased PSN game; you may delete it afterwards)\n\n2. Install NPUJ01363_Chrono Trigger_FIX.pkg\n\n3.
