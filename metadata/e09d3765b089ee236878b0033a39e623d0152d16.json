When I first saw this movie, I will admit I didn't find it that funny. But it's one of those movies that grows on you with time. Even if you don't like it at first, give it some time. You have to accept this movie for what it is. A dark comedy aimed at poking fun of the lighter things in life. Jim Carrey obviously carries the movie with his infamous quirkiness, but Matthew Broderick holds his own as the anal retentive guy which he is great at playing. Whether you are talking about the Midevil Times restaurant scene or the karaoke scene, this movie is a gem. Highly recommended.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e09d3765b089ee236878b0033a39e623d0152d16","amp;dn":"The+Cable+Guy+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e09d3765b089ee236878b0033a39e623d0152d16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,157,55,101,176,137,238,35,104,120,176,3,58,57,230,35,208,21,45,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
