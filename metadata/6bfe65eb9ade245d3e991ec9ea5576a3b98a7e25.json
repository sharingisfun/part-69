The townspeople long suspected the Sawyer family, owners of a local barbeque pit, were somehow responsible. Their suspicions were finally confirmed one hot summer day when a young woman escaped the Sawyer house following the brutal murders of her four friends. Word around the small town quickly spread, and a vigilante mob of enraged locals surrounded the Sawyer stronghold, burning it to the ground and killing every last member of the family--or so they thought. Decades later and hundreds of miles away from the original massacre, a young woman named Heather learns that she has inherited a Texas estate from a grandmother she never knew she had. After embarking on a road trip with friends to uncover her roots, she finds she is the sole owner of a lavish, isolated Victorian mansion. But her newfound wealth comes at a price as she stumbles upon a horror that awaits her in the mansion's dank cellars...\n\nAUDIO\nAudio Codec: AAC\nAudio Sample Rate: 48 kHz, 16 bit\nAudio Bit Rate: 768 kb/s\nAudio Channels: Multi, 5.1 (Up-Mix)\nAudio Language: english\n\nVIDEO\nVideo Codec: H.264 (High 10-bit LE)\nVideo Color Profile: YUV, 4:2:2\nVideo Resolution: 1920x800 (1080p)\nVideo Data Rate: 9.3 MB/s (1080p)\nVideo Frame Rate: 23.976 fps\nVideo SAR: 1:1\nVideo DAR: 2.35:1\n\nSOURCE\nSource: Apple QuickTime Trailer File, 720p/1080p\nRelease: 09/13/2012\nRuntime: 2:30\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6bfe65eb9ade245d3e991ec9ea5576a3b98a7e25","amp;dn":"Texas.Chainsaw.3D.2013.trailer1.1080p.WEB.DL.AAC.x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6bfe65eb9ade245d3e991ec9ea5576a3b98a7e25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,254,101,235,154,222,36,93,62,153,30,201,234,85,118,163,185,138,126,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
