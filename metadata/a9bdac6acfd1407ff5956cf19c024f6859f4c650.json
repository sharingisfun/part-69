It is your ticket to getting your life, be it personal, work or social, better organized.\nGroovy Notes leverages the ease of use of a diary by employing the capabilities of your device such as the ability to record voice notes and touch gestures to navigate between views.\n\nIt is realistic!\nGroovy Notes has a familiar, real world diary like interface. The pages look natural enough to make you want to turn them over. Be it notes, memos, anniversaries, lists, to-dos or even your personal journal - everything can be easily managed with Groovy Notes. All the notes are well organized by categories, tags and date. WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more, the categories can be customized with attractive colors and icons to make them funkier, fun and easier to manage and notice!\n\nSearching has never been so easy!\nSearching for that crucial note, in the nick of time, is as easy as tapping a button on Groovy Notes. Use the calendar to find the notes by dates, pick a category, tag or just type in a keyword and search! Even the search results are color coded, based on category.\n\nBecause voice has a ring to it!\nDonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t feel like tapping on your keypad? Just record your thoughts in your own voice (or an entire conversation or meeting). With a single tap you can record your voice memos and convert your regular notes into voice notes. WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more, you can continue taking notes from the same meeting that you are recording! Both functions working simultaneously, now that is an added advantage. Organize the voice notes just as you would other notes with tags, category, date and text but yet feel, or should we say hear the difference.\n\nNever lose your data!\nGroovyNotes comes with features to export, backup and synchronize your notes with DropBox. You can export your notes as PDF, plain text and MP3, backup your data to your DropBox account and restore it back in case of a device failure or wipeout.
