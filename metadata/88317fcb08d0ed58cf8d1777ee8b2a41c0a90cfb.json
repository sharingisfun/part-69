Doc and Marty both read the paper from the next day to find that Marty's grandfather, Arthur McFly, was gunned down in Courthouse Square, proven by Marty's father vanishing from a photograph of him. They decide to take the DeLorean back to 4 pm that afternoon, however, Doc is stopped by a local police officer out on the road and detained. Marty, just barely avoiding capture, sneaks around the DeLorean to start the engine and takes off for the not-to-distant past. Marty cleverly avoids his other self, who has since convinced Doc's younger self to work on the drill. Marty notices a man, Zane, getting closer to the Courthouse. Marty interferes with Zane's plans, preventing Arthur from being shot. Instead, Arthur is given chloroform and taken to the basement of the Sisters of Mercy Soup Kitchen where he is interrogated about the subpoena. Marty hides in a box and is carried to the basement by Cue Ball. From the bar, Marty witnesses the interrogation. He takes out the gang members one by one and rescues a drowsy Arthur. Marty places Arthur in the DeLorean and they drive out to the sign where they parked the DeLorean before and, coincidentally at the right time, finds the Doc being held up by the Police Officer from earlier/later and Martys past self escaping in the DeLorean. Marty drives past the other DeLorean, picks up Doc, and escape. Arthur desires to leave Hill Valley, but Doc and Marty quickly stop him, concluding that he must get together with Sylvia in order to have George McFly and subsequently Marty born in the process. They convince Arthur that meeting Silvia is part of a sting operation to stop Kid. After, Doc and Marty head back to 1986. \n\nSystem Requirements :\n\nOS: XP/Vista/7\nCPU: 2.0 GHz + (3 GHz Pentium 4 or equivalent rec.)\nRAM: 512MB (1GB rec.)\nGPU: 64MB DirectX 8.1-compliant video card (128MB rec.)\nDirectX: 9.0c or better\n\nList Of Other Releases by [Espera] :\n\nAge Of Empires II (2) plus The Conquerors Portable - [Espera]\nAge of Empires III (3) plus Expansions Portable - [Espera]\nAge of Wonders Portable - [Espera]\nAge of Wonders II Portable - [Espera]\nAge of Wonders Shadow Magic Portable - [Espera]\nAngry Birds Portable - [Espera]\nAngry Birds Rio Portable - [Espera]\nAngry Birds Seasons Portable - [Espera]\nBack To The Future The Game Portable - [Espera]\nBattle vs. Chess Portable - [Espera]\nBattlefield 1942 plus WWII plus RTR - [Espera]\nBeyond Good and Evil Portable - [Espera]\nBlack And White 2 Portable - [Espera]\nBlack And White Portable - [Espera]\nBlade And Sword Portable - [Espera]\nBlade Kitten Portable - [Espera]\nCall Of Duty plus United Offensive Portable - [Espera]\nCommandos 3 Destination Berlin Portable - [Espera]\nCommandos 2 Men Of Courage Portable - [Espera]\nCommandos Behind Enemy Lines Portable - [Espera]\nCommandos Beyond The Call Of Duty Portable - [Espera]\nCrazy Taxi 3 High Roller Portable - [Espera]\nDead to Rights Portable - [Espera]\nDelta Force Xtreme Portable - [Espera]\nEmpire Earth plus AoC Portable - [Espera]\nFahrenheit Portable - [Espera]\nFIFA 12 MULTI 9 Portable - [Espera]\nFlatOut 2 Portable - [Espera]\nFreedom Fighters Portable - [Espera]\nFruit Ninja HD Portable - [Espera]\nGrand Theft Auto II (GTA 2) Portable - [Espera]\nHospital Tycoon Portable - [Espera]\nMafia Portable - [Espera]\nMax Payne 2 Portable (with mods) - [Espera]\nMax Payne Portable - [Espera]\nMegaman (Rockman) X8 - [Espera]\nMonopoly Tycoon Portable - [Espera]\nMortal Kombat 4 Portable - [Espera]\nNaval Warfare Portable - [Espera]\nNeed For Speed Most Wanted Portable - [Espera]\nNeed For Speed Underground 2 Portable - [Espera]\nNeed For Speed Underground Portable - [Espera]\nNeighbours From Hell 2 Portable - [Espera]\nNeighbours From Hell Portable - [Espera]\nOnimusha Warlords Portable - [Espera]\nPlants Vs Zombies Portable - [Espera]\nPrince Of Persia Warrior Within Portable - [Espera]\nQuake 3 Arena plus Team Arena Portable - [Espera]\nRed Alert 2 plus Yuris Revenge Portable - [Espera]\nRollerCoaster Tycoon 3 Platinum Portable - [Espera]\nSimCity 4 Portable - [Espera]\nSonic Adventure DX Portable - [Espera]\nSpider-Man The Movie Portable - [Espera]\nStar Wars Empire At War Portable - [Espera]\nStar Wars Galactic Battlegrounds Clone Campaigns Portable - [Espera]\nStar Wars Jedi Knight Jedi Academy Portable - [Espera]\nStar Wars Knights Of The Old Republic Portable - [Espera]\nStar Wars Republic Commando Portable - [Espera]\nStarCraft plus BroodWar Portable - [Espera]\nState Of Emergency Portable - [Espera]\nStreet Racing Battle Portable - [Espera]\nTrapped Dead Portable - [Espera]\nTron 2.0 Portable - [Espera]\nThe Asskickers Portable - [Espera]\nThe Godfather Portable - [Espera]\nThe Punisher Portable - [Espera]\nThe Sims 3 Collector's Edition Portable - [Espera]\nTony Hawks Pro Skater 4 Portable - [Espera]\nWarcraft III (3) Reign Of Chaos and Frozen Throne Portable - [Espera]\nWarhammer 40k Dawn Of War plus Winter Assault Portable - [Espera]\nZombie Revenge Portable - [Espera]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88317fcb08d0ed58cf8d1777ee8b2a41c0a90cfb","amp;dn":"Back+To+The+Future+2+Get+Tannen+Portable+-+%5BEspera%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88317fcb08d0ed58cf8d1777ee8b2a41c0a90cfb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,49,127,203,8,208,237,88,207,141,23,119,238,139,42,65,192,169,12,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
