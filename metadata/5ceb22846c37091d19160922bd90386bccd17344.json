Unlike European ones they don't suffer from irresistible longing for gold and the odd princess. They are not hunted by hordes of mad knights; quite the reverse, people honor and respect them. Enter the marvellous world of Oriental fairy-tales and get acquainted with one of these dragons.\nThe main goal of Dragon's Lore is the removal of figures from a game field. Try to match pieces of the same colour by adding new cubes, this is the way to score points and earn game money. Various bonuses will help you to cope with tough levels and the dreaded timer.\nDragon's Lore has several game modes. &quot;Story&quot; tells a tale about a quest of the dragon Kirin. You'll gradually pass through levels with different tasks, compete with bosses and upgrade your hero. &quot;Classic&quot; and &quot;Arcade&quot; games give you a pack of levels in which you must remove a number of cubes in a very short time, or play without time limits. &quot;Puzzle&quot; mode forces you to think hard about the best solution for different riddles in this mode. &quot;Infinity&quot; mode allows you to play as long as you wish, set outstanding high-scores until there are no possible moves.\nThere's even a HotSeat mode for a chance to enjoy the game with your friends.\nGame features:\nÃ¢Ëœâ€¦ 4 single player game modes\nÃ¢Ëœâ€¦ HotSeat mode\nÃ¢Ëœâ€¦ About 200 levels\nÃ¢Ëœâ€¦ Story mode with a full-blooded plot and upgrade system\n\n\n                                By bobiras2009\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ceb22846c37091d19160922bd90386bccd17344","amp;dn":"Dragon%27s+Lore+v1.0+Full+By+bobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ceb22846c37091d19160922bd90386bccd17344","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,235,34,132,108,55,9,29,25,22,9,34,189,144,56,107,204,209,115,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
