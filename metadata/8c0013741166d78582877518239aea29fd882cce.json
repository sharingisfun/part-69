While this is divided topically, the topics are presented in a comparatively chronological order, and thereby trace the development of the subject to the present century. The term ''mental healing'' is given the broadest possible use, and comprehends any cures which may be brought about by the effect of the mind over the body, regardless of whether the power back of the cure is supposed to be deity, demons, other human beings, or the individual mind of the patient.
