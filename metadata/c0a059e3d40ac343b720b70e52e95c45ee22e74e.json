There are a lot of cheap video cards for sale, which often have extensions like &quot;mx&quot; or &quot;le&quot;. Such 'budget' cards often display visual errors in many games, or suffer from bad performance in high performance games. \n\nWe have done our best to support all of these cards, but in case you still suffer from bad performance, please refer to the video-options section in the manual contained on the CD. Also, make sure you keep your video card drivers up to date. New video card drivers will decrease visual errors and increase overall performance.\n\nEnjoy      -cwele97-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0a059e3d40ac343b720b70e52e95c45ee22e74e","amp;dn":"Taxi+3+Extreme+Rush+Full+game","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0a059e3d40ac343b720b70e52e95c45ee22e74e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,160,89,227,212,10,195,67,183,32,183,14,82,233,92,69,238,34,231,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
