David Shukman reports from a Norwegian research station deep inside the Arctic Circle and witnesses the impact of a record-breaking summer thaw.\n\nOngoing changes in the climate of the Arctic include rising temperatures, loss of sea ice, and melting of the Greenland ice sheet. The Arctic ocean will likely be free of summer sea ice before the year 2100\n\nProjections as to when precisely this will occur vary greatly. Because of the amplified response of the Arctic to global warming, it is often seen as a high-sensitivity indicator of climate change.\n\n\nFile Name ..........: Our.World.The.Big.Melt-tbz.avi\n\n\n185.55 MB/00:22:11/mns/mpg4\n\n\n\n\nSource: http://thebox.bz/details.php?id=210480\nUpped by\tottopilot\n\nshunster","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9062edf8a3195c6db7c25ce97e7af01f93f0a2d0","amp;dn":"The+Big+Melt%7E2012+09+28+++BBC+Our+World+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9062edf8a3195c6db7c25ce97e7af01f93f0a2d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,98,237,248,163,25,92,109,183,194,92,233,126,122,240,31,147,240,162,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
