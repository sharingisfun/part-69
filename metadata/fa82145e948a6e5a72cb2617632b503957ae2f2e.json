I guess I could have scanned the tokens for one to print but you can use coins or some other small markers.\n\nYou will need markers and a deck of cards to play this.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nsbogo","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa82145e948a6e5a72cb2617632b503957ae2f2e","amp;dn":"Po-Ke-No.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa82145e948a6e5a72cb2617632b503957ae2f2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,130,20,94,148,138,110,90,114,203,38,23,99,43,80,57,87,174,47,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
