Armed with their fists, feet, and whatever weapons they should find along the way, players are tasked with ridding an unnamed city of zombies.\n\nOriginally titled Blood Bullet: The House of the Dead Side Story, the game was later renamed Zombies Nightmare before Sega decided on the name Zombie Revenge. This game also serves as a spinoff to Sega's popular House of the Dead series of light gun games.[1] To this end, zombies sound and look the same as they did in the first game, and the main protagonists from both the original series and Revenge are AMS agents. At the start of the game, computer icons of Thomas Rogan and &quot;G&quot; can be seen on Linda's desktop. The Curien Mansion seen in the first House of the Dead appears as its own stage, called &quot;The House of the Dead&quot; and the music from the first stage is used. The final boss of Revenge is called Black Magician Type 01. The game's credits sequence are also similar, going back through the game's stages to the beginning of the game.\n\nSystem requirements\n\n500 MHz CPU, \n256 MB RAM, \n800 MB hard disk space, \n32 MB GPU","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:840f1be54a186f353df2652f8538662e00eb4824","amp;dn":"Zombie+Revenge+Portable+-+%5BEspera%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"840f1be54a186f353df2652f8538662e00eb4824","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,15,27,229,74,24,111,53,61,242,101,47,133,56,102,46,0,235,72,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
