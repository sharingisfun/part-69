In full screen applications it automatically hides and in some applications like ZPlayer it becomes transparent for seamless integration.\n\nIn order for StatusBar+ to handle third-party notifications it MUST be enabled in System Settings &gt; Accessibility and NOT in the app itself1\n\nStatusBar+ is more than just a custom status bar. It comes bundled with its own MIUI-style battery bar, the ability to change any and all indicators to any color your heart desires, features for users with AMOLED screens to avoid pixel burn-in, popup notifications, and much more.\n\nCurrently supported system indicators include Signal strength (GSM, EVDO, and CDMA. 4G HSPA+, WiMax, and LTE experimental), Data network type (ie. EDGE, 3G, 4G, etc.), WiFi signal strength &amp; WiFi Access Point, Bluetooth, Language, GPS, Battery percentage &amp; icon, Time (automatic 24-hour detection based on the system preference), and more coming soon.\n\nSignal Strength:\nSignal strength calculation may not work properly on your device. The Samsung Galaxy S II line and Sony Ericsson Arc running Gingerbread 2.3.X, for example, have a documented issue (see http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=16862). If you run into problems with signal strength please try our other application, Signal Strength Detector (see http://market.android.com/details?id=com.tombarrasso.android.signaldetector), available for free on the Android Market and submit your results. This will help us further improve calculation.\n\nWhat's in this version : (Updated : Aug 27, 2012)\n\n    Added the ability to hide in the homescreen/ launcher.\n    Fixed a number of bugs with Accessibility, Jelly Bean, and more.\n\nRequired Android O/S : 2.1+\n\n\n\n                                By bobiras2009\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb2a096fddda1c733887f584ef1009ff94de2d97","amp;dn":"StatusBar%2BCustom+Status+Bar+vPetunia+Build+34+Final+bobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb2a096fddda1c733887f584ef1009ff94de2d97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,42,9,111,221,218,28,115,56,135,245,132,239,16,9,255,148,222,45,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
