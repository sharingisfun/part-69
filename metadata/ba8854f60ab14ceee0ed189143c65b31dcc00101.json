So 10\n\nyears later, he unsuccessfully tries to eliminate\n\nBarts but in the process makes the acquaintance of\n\nHenry Sturgess who teaches him how to fight and what\n\nis required to kill a vampire. \n\nThe quid pro quo is that Abe will kill only those\n\nvampires that Henry directs him to. Abe relocates to\n\nSpringfield where he gets a job as a store clerk\n\nwhile he studies the law and kills vampires by\n\nnight. \n\nHe also meets and eventually marries the pretty Mary\n\nTodd. \n\nMany years later as President of the United States,\n\nhe comes to realize that vampires are fighting with\n\nthe Confederate forces. \n\nAs a result he mounts his own campaign to defeat\n\nthem.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba8854f60ab14ceee0ed189143c65b31dcc00101","amp;dn":"Abraham+Lincoln+Vampire.Hunter+2012+Bluray+720p+johno70","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba8854f60ab14ceee0ed189143c65b31dcc00101","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,136,84,246,10,177,76,238,224,237,24,145,67,198,91,49,220,192,1,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
