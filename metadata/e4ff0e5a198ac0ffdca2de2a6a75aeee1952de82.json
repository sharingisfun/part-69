I'm Pastor Hal Mayer, and I have an incredible message for you today. As I think back over the last year at the rapid-fire disasters that have accumulated in the world, I am astonished. The world has gone wild. A staggering number of people were killed by sudden disasters ranging from earthquakes, floods, volcanoes, fires and other major catastrophes. The earth reeled to and fro from it all. One authority suggested that the earth struck back in 2010.\n\nThe Pre-Tribulation Rapture Judgment:\n\nMost haven't heard it presented this way before.\n\nProphecy and the Rapture by John Walvoord:\n\nJohn F. Walvoord (May 1, 1910 -- December 20, 2002), was a Christian theologian, pastor, and president of Dallas Theological Seminary from 1952 to 1986. He was the author of over 30 books, focusing primarily on eschatology and theology including The Rapture Question, and was co-editor of The Bible Knowledge Commentary with Roy B. Zuck. He earned AB and DD degrees from Wheaton College, an AM degree from Texas Christian University in philosophy, a ThB, ThM, and ThD in Systematic theology from Dallas Theological Seminary, and a LittD from Liberty Baptist Seminary.\n\n\nThis is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.\n\nThese Torrents are currently on a Free Leech --  High Speed Server\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\n\n      :thankyou:    :thankyou:     Thank You JESUS  \n \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4ff0e5a198ac0ffdca2de2a6a75aeee1952de82","amp;dn":"POtHS+-+Fire+and+Brimstone+Vol+11+-+Called+to+the+Wedding+Supper","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4ff0e5a198ac0ffdca2de2a6a75aeee1952de82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,255,14,90,25,138,192,255,220,162,222,42,106,117,174,238,25,82,222,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
