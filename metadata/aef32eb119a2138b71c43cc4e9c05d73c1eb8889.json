Champions Manchester City meet Stoke at the Britannia Stadium, which was the scene of a Peter Crouch wonder strike when then teams drew there last season. Manchester United entertain Wigan, while Fulham manager Martin Jol sees his team play West Brom, a club he represented in his playing career.\n\nArsenal play host to Southampton, hoping to score their first league goals of the season at the Emirates after being held 0-0 there by Sunderland on the opening day. Other fixtures include a west London derby, with QPR also looking to banish memories of their most recent league game at Loftus Road, a 5-0 thumping by Swansea - but Mark Hughes' side face a tough task, with European champions Chelsea the visitors.\n\nElsewhere, Liverpool travel to Sunderland, Norwich host West Ham and Swansea visit Aston Villa.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aef32eb119a2138b71c43cc4e9c05d73c1eb8889","amp;dn":"Match+of+the+Day+15.09.2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aef32eb119a2138b71c43cc4e9c05d73c1eb8889","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,243,46,177,25,162,19,139,113,196,60,196,233,192,93,115,193,235,136,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
