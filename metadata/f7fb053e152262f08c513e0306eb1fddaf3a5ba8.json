IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m sorry if they become a nuisance.\n\n\nMost of these are legitimate free downloads, some are not, but I tried to justify their inclusion.\nIf the song is copyrighted, I included it because:\n* ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s out of print (see Decoder, technically those two Pharoahe Monch songs)\n* ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a mainstream rap artist whom I am not significantly undercutting (just a couple of these songs, seriously, does Dr. Dre even know how the fuck a torrent works?)\n* It's from RCRD LBL, whose files are free but not meant to be mirrored. Who cares, there's maybe 4 songs for this\n\n\nI key my music and write it in the comment section, but take note:\n* I DON'T USE THE CAMELOT WHEEL\n* I go by musical note, I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t distinguish major or minor, and a lot of songs are probably mislabeled, but they should fit when you hear them.\n* I speed songs up or slow them down and judge the key for a universal tempo, either 175 or 140 BPM.\n\nSome keys have added notations, THIS IS NOT BY ACCIDENT:\n^ means it is technically a different genre from dubstep or drum &amp; bass\n( ) means it is a semitone higher than the listed key.\n\nSo for example, 146 BPM industrial rock tune ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œStarfuckers Inc.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ reads as ^D#\n* The song can be played with dubstep, but is not technically dubstep\n* When slowed to 140 BPM (and pitched down in the process), its key becomes D# (I think minor but I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t differentiate to keep things simple)\n\nAnd for example, 170 BPM drum &amp; bass tune ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSurgeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ by SPKTRM reads as (E F)\n* When sped up to 175 BPM, its key is offset by a semitone\n* The song starts in E (I think minor?) and eventually changes to F-something (I probably got this wrong)\n\n\n\n\n\nDrop me a line if you found this torrent helpful, I have a personal website (with contact info) at www.luciusnatick.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7fb053e152262f08c513e0306eb1fddaf3a5ba8","amp;dn":"97+Percent+Legit+Free+Dubstep+Drum+N+Bass+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7fb053e152262f08c513e0306eb1fddaf3a5ba8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,251,5,62,21,34,98,240,140,81,62,3,6,235,31,221,175,58,91,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
