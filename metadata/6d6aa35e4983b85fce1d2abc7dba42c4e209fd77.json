He's introduced to a quirky cast of characters -- including a loudmouthed lush (Michel Vuillermoz) and a vodka-sipping vixen (Melanie Thierry) -- who reveal the hazards of falling off the wagon too many times. Godeau (who founded Gallic shingle Pan-Europeenne) tackles the action all too safely, showcasing fine production values.\n\n\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d6aa35e4983b85fce1d2abc7dba42c4e209fd77","amp;dn":"Le+Dernier+Pour+La+Route+aka+One+For+The+Road+2009+DVDRip+Sonata","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d6aa35e4983b85fce1d2abc7dba42c4e209fd77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,106,163,94,73,131,184,95,206,29,42,188,125,186,66,196,226,9,253,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
