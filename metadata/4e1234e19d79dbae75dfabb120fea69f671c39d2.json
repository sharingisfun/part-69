Join Pastor Philip Sizemore as he analyzes the symbolism of this parable and its urgent message to all people today.\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Testimony of Tom Cantor, Completed Jew:\nIsrael Restoration Mimistries\nTom Cantor\nHi, my name is Tom Cantor, and I'd like to tell you about the greatest thing that happened in my life. You know, I'm a scientist. I graduated from the University of California at San Diego in biochemistry. And I started a business in my garage with just $130. And today, it's grown to be a debt-free, mortgage-free, investor-free biotech company, with nearly 700 employees. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.israelrestoration.org/tom-cantor.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.israelrestoration.org/tom-cantor.html&lt;/a&gt;\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSeed long and Prosper with Blessings from our Father. I have prayed to The Father, Bless all that Seed Long.
