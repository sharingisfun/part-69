It's an exciting and creative concept that addresses the insights gleaned from our research in a very innovative way, adding that the animations would create a more demographically accessible face for McLaren.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c915a12cb83af45d706a716b8c5d6a73a150a56","amp;dn":"McLaren+Animation+Tooned+Episode+8+Lecture+Circuit+%28Re-Up%2FError+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c915a12cb83af45d706a716b8c5d6a73a150a56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,145,90,18,203,131,175,69,215,6,167,22,184,197,214,167,58,21,10,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
