The Baggies followed up a stunning opening day win over Liverpool with a point against Tottenham at White Hart Lane to give new manager Steve Clarke a dream introduction to life at West Brom.\n\nThe same cannot be said for Paul Lambert's opening matches in charge of Villa; he was able to bolster his thin-looking squad on deadline day, and now needs his side to pick up points to avoid being sucked into a relegation battle come the end of the season.\n\nThere is also the chance to catch up on all of the goals from Saturday's games.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c79d41b38713c1a7aed5e1446278fa0b14449b77","amp;dn":"Match+of+the+Day+Two+30.09.2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c79d41b38713c1a7aed5e1446278fa0b14449b77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,157,65,179,135,19,193,167,174,213,225,68,98,120,250,11,20,68,155,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
