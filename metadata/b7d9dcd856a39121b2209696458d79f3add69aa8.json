Your cab is equipped with a special boost, \n\nto gain leverage during jumps, drifts, etc. Earning money is the central point of the gameplay. Once a customer \n\nenters your vehicle, you'll be free to use any means necessary in order to reach a particular location on time. The \n\nbasic idea is to make it a fun ride, so your fair would tip the cabdriver. Hazardous driving through crowded \n\nstreets is the best way to earn extra money. Customers will be cheering as your cab flies into the air or rushes \n\nstraight between two oncoming vehicles. The most important thing in the game, besides picking up passengers on the \n\nstreet, is beating the clock in order to gain extra seconds. Taking shortcuts is usually the best way to do this. \n\nAs you ride through the city districts at high speed, you'll be running into plenty of obstacles that can slow you \n\ndown; from lampposts, mailboxes, monuments, etc. Also, the sidewalks are crawling with people that go about their \n\ndaily business. Unlike GTA: Vice City, Crazy Taxi 3 does away with blood and gore. No matter how hard you try, \n\npedestrians simply won't allow themselves to be flattened by your cab; which kinda seems funny, when you notice \n\ngrandpa Jo leaping sideways like a Ninja in order to avoid being hit by your cab. \n\nMinimum System Requirements\nOS: Windows 98/ME/2000/XP\nProcessor: Pentium 3 @ 1 GHz or Athlon Equivalent\nMemory: 256 MB\nHard Drive: 500 MB Free\nVideo Memory: 64 MB (nVidia GeForce 3/ATI Radeon 8500)\nSound Card: DirectX Compatible\nDirectX: 9.0\nKeyboard &amp; Mouse\nCD/DVD Rom Drive \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7d9dcd856a39121b2209696458d79f3add69aa8","amp;dn":"Crazy+Taxi+3+High+Roller+Portable+-+%5BEspera%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7d9dcd856a39121b2209696458d79f3add69aa8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,217,220,216,86,163,145,33,178,32,150,150,69,141,121,243,173,214,154,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
