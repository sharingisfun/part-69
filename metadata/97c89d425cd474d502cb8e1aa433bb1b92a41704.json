Never interrupts your music.\nPause Music Mode:Ã¢â‚¬Â¨\n\n+Uses your headset's microphone to listen for loud noises and pause your music if one is detected, then play back the sound that triggered the pause and continues for a short period of time the optionally resumes your music.\n\n\nPro Amp:\n\n    Pause and Resume work but have to set option:\n    Settings-&gt; Audio Engine -&gt; Audio Focus Change -&gt; Check &quot;Short Audio Focus Change&quot;\n    Pause works but stops the music and the notification bar service.\n    Uber Music:\n    Pause and Resume works. Pause works but stops the music and the notification bar service.\n    MixZing:\n    Unfortunately the current version of MixZing doesn't seem to handle calls from other applications requesting audio control like a music app should.\n\nNote:\nThis is my first app so please send me feedback good or bad. If something is wrong let me know first before giving a low rating. Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Also don't use any task killer apps, they will probably kill this program. And they're not really worth using anyways.\n\nWhat's in this version: (Updated : Sep 19, 2012)\n\n    Fixed Bugs: Some settings not being saved and initialized properly\n    Fixed Bug: Default not being saved for Target Media App\n\nRequired Android O/S : 2.2+\n\n\n\n                                By bobiras2009\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97c89d425cd474d502cb8e1aa433bb1b92a41704","amp;dn":"Around+Sound+Pro+v2.23+Final+By+bobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97c89d425cd474d502cb8e1aa433bb1b92a41704","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,200,157,66,92,212,116,213,2,203,142,26,164,51,187,27,146,164,23,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
