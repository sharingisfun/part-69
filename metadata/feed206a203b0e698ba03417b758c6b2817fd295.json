ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an exciting and creative concept that addresses the insights gleaned from our research in a very innovative way, adding that the animations would create a more demographically accessible face for McLaren.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:feed206a203b0e698ba03417b758c6b2817fd295","amp;dn":"McLaren+Animation+Tooned+Episode+3+Track+to+the+Future.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"feed206a203b0e698ba03417b758c6b2817fd295","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,237,32,106,32,59,14,105,139,160,52,23,183,88,198,178,129,127,210,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
