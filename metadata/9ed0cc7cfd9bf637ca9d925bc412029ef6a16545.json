If only some parts of hardware will change, clever scheduler wonÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“t redo all the long testing, but only tests relevant to hardware changes.\n    Distributed: due to modular architecture, Inquisitor can be easily distributed across a cluster to distribute load or make a geographically distributed system.\n    Scalable: it could be helpful to analyse/test just one home computer or all the computers in your organization, up to multiple thousands computers in manufacturing enterprise.\n    Free as in speech: the base platform is distributed under the GPL license.\n    Mature: Inquisitor is based on a rock-solid Linux technology and is under active development since 2004. There are multiple production enterprise installations relying on it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ed0cc7cfd9bf637ca9d925bc412029ef6a16545","amp;dn":"Inquisitor+Linux+Live+3.1+Beta+2+32+Bit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ed0cc7cfd9bf637ca9d925bc412029ef6a16545","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,208,204,124,253,155,246,55,202,157,146,91,196,18,2,158,246,161,101,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
