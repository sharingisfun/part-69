Starting out at Leeds, David resisted signing for Don RevieÃ¢â‚¬â€later followed by CloughÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Forest and Manchester United. He played an incredible 356 consecutive matches for Middlesbrough before being forced out after 10 years. On to Saints with Keegan, Ball, and ChannonÃ¢â‚¬â€and more near misses in the league and cup. ArmstrongÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s promising England career was sadly curtailed by a falling-out with Bobby Robson, and just four years later he was forced to sign on the dole. The break-up of his first marriage, his desperate desire for an ankle amputation, and bailiffs at the door lend DavidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s riches-to-rags story of stardom and poverty a human appeal far beyond soccer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a61735ae4692317c13c216b8cd56695a29756b6","amp;dn":"The+Bald+Facts+The+David+Armstrong+Biography+by+Pat+Symes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a61735ae4692317c13c216b8cd56695a29756b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,97,115,90,228,105,35,23,193,60,33,107,140,213,102,149,162,151,86,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
