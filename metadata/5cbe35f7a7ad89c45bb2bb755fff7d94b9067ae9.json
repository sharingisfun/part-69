Yay!\n\n\nEpisode description:\nRick experiences thrilling water adventures Flyboarding in Sylvan Lake, Alberta and later visits Science World in Vancouver.\n\nShow description:\nRick Mercer Report is a Canadian television comedy series which airs on CBC Television. Launched in 2004 and hosted by comedian Rick Mercer, the weekly half-hour show combines news parody, sketch comedy, visits to interesting places across Canada, and satirical editorials, often involving Canadian politics. The show's format is similar in some respects to satirical news shows like Mercer's prior series, This Hour Has 22 Minutes, and to Jon Stewart's The Daily Show Ã¢â‚¬â€œ however, the Mercer Report's on-location segments are usually played relatively straight in comparison to those on the other shows, since participants are usually aware of Mercer's identity and purpose.\n\n\n--- File Information ---                                                        \nFile Name        : Rick.Mercer.Report.S10E01.2012-09-18.HDTV.x264-CLDD.mp4\nFormat            : MPEG-4 at 1 365 Kbps\nLength            : 213 MiB for 21mn 51s 530ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 1 192 Kbps\nAspect            : 720 x 400 (1.800) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AAC at 168 Kbps\nInfos                : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage         : en\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5cbe35f7a7ad89c45bb2bb755fff7d94b9067ae9","amp;dn":"Rick.Mercer.Report.S10E01.2012-09-18.HDTV.x264-CLDD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5cbe35f7a7ad89c45bb2bb755fff7d94b9067ae9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,190,53,247,167,173,137,196,91,178,187,117,95,255,125,148,185,6,122,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
