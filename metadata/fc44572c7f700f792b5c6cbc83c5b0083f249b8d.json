A specific emphasis will be on the statistical and decision-theoretic modeling paradigm. By the end of this course, you will have built autonomous agents that efficiently make decisions in stochastic and adversarial settings, draw inferences in uncertain environments, and optimize actions for arbitrary reward structures. Your machine learning algorithms will classify handwritten digits and photographs. The techniques you learn in CS188x apply to a wide variety of artificial intelligence problems and will serve as the foundation for further study in any application area you choose to pursue.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc44572c7f700f792b5c6cbc83c5b0083f249b8d","amp;dn":"BerkeleyX%3A+CS188.1x+Artificial+Intelligence","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc44572c7f700f792b5c6cbc83c5b0083f249b8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,68,87,44,127,112,15,121,43,92,108,188,131,197,176,8,63,36,155,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
