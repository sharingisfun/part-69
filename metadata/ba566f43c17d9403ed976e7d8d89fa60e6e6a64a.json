They pander to voters, manipulate facts...and break promises.\n\nThis week, I criticize President Obama and Mitt Romney for doing just that. President Obama claimed that he would cut spending - but then he increased it by more than $450 billion per year. Romney says he supports small government, but he opposes any cuts to the military, education, and the drug war. Ellis Henican and Ann Coulter defend their respective candidates.\n\nMark Block, the &quot;smoking man&quot; from Herman Cain's much talked about ad, discusses off-beat ads and their impact.\n\nAndrea Tantaros used to be a spokeswoman for the House Republicans - she explains the need for &quot;spin.&quot;\n\nMarketing expert Rohit Bhargava, author of Likeonomics, explains how politicians could learn from messaging by Costco and Domino's Pizza.\n\nI say it's all propaganda.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba566f43c17d9403ed976e7d8d89fa60e6e6a64a","amp;dn":"20121025-Stossel-%5BPolitical+Propaganda%5D.Fox+Business.CF.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba566f43c17d9403ed976e7d8d89fa60e6e6a64a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,86,111,67,193,125,148,3,237,151,110,125,141,137,250,96,230,230,166,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
