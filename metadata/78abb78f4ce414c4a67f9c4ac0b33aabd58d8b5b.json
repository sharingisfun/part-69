Just because I know how frustrating is after installing a new operating system to look for apps in different CD's DVD's etc or Surf the net countless hours in finding the right , working application that suits your needs .\n\nSolution:\n\nI have organized this DVD (8,5 GB) in such a way that is very user friendly.\nIn the Root Folder [right after you open the image] you will find the main base folders that will contain all other (specific) data . Every folder has it's own type of applications .\n\nFor instance in &quot;Audio Utilities&quot; you will find only audio related applications for example : &quot;Winamp&quot;\n\nWhy this DVD ?\n\nMainly because it's well organized , safe to use and easy to operate with . It contains the direct app's, this means they are not in archives so you will need to do extra work when installing one product , the installation executables are waiting for you to open them right in the respecive folder of the respected (named) application.\n\nAnother Reason would be the 'updates' , in a larger sense , the new applications , they are always recommended because they have solved earlier builts bugs and newer apps are always more stable than older ones . Of course new is not always better but I have carefully selected for you the best of the best applications so you can enjoy a full multimedia experience and not just install bloatware (unneeded software) .\n\nWhat does the DVD Contain ?\n\nIt does contain all necessary software for a PC to run more than smoothly and safe .\n\nI'll begin by showing you the content of the DVD:\n\n&lt;Adobe &amp; Foxit Reader&gt;              \n&lt;Adobe Flash &amp; Shockwave Player&gt;\n&lt;Archivators&gt;                  \n&lt;Audio Software&gt;              \n&lt;Bluetooth Software&gt;            \n&lt;Browsers&gt;                      \n&lt;CD DVD &amp; Blu-Ray Burners&gt;                \n&lt;CPU GPU RAM &amp; System Detailers&gt;    \n&lt;DC's ++ &amp; Tools&gt;          \n&lt;DirectX 9.0c&gt;                                  \n&lt;Email Clients &amp; Tools&gt;                  \n&lt;Emulator Softwares &amp; Game Tools&gt;\n&lt;Instant Messengers&gt;                          \n&lt;Java Runtime Environment&gt;                  \n&lt;Mouse Enhancements &amp; Font Tools&gt;            \n&lt;MS Office 2003 Professional Lite &amp; 2010 Consumer&gt;      \n&lt;MS Windows OS &amp; Office Suite Updates&gt;          \n&lt;OS Forcers Unlockers Activators Decrypters&gt;    \n&lt;Partition - Recovery &amp; Backup Software&gt;  \n&lt;Photo &amp; Design Software&gt;      \n&lt;Security Advisors&gt;\n&lt;Text Editors&gt;\n&lt;Tweakers &amp; Optimizators&gt;    \n&lt;Uninstall Software&gt;                                                    \n&lt;Video Software &amp; &lt;Utilities&gt;\n&lt;[Driver Utilities - For Finding Proper &lt;Drivers]&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78abb78f4ce414c4a67f9c4ac0b33aabd58d8b5b","amp;dn":"Applications+in+one+DVD+Updated+October+2012+Deluxe+DVD9+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78abb78f4ce414c4a67f9c4ac0b33aabd58d8b5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,171,183,143,76,228,20,196,166,127,156,74,192,179,58,171,213,141,139,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
