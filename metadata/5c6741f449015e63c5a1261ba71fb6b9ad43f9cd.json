When you become the head of the country all the responsibility for the land's prosperity rests on your royal shoulders. You will have to fight various enemies and monsters, explore new territories, manage economic and scientific developments and solve a heap of unusual and unexpected tasks. For example, what will you do when all the gold in the kingdom transforms into cookies? Or how will you bring back the trolls who robbed caravans and whose disappearance ruins the economy of the country?\nThe core feature of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Majesty: The Fantasy Kingdom SimÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is that you cannot control your citizens directly. There are a lot of heroes in your lands: valiant warriors and warlike barbarians, powerful wizards and grim necromancers, industrious dwarves and skilful elves plus many more. But all of them live their own lives and decide for themselves what to do at any moment. You are able to issue orders but heroes will follow your commands only for a sizeable reward.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Majesty: The Fantasy Kingdom SimÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ contains elements of role play: while fulfilling your orders, the heroes improve their skills and talents, as well as earn cash to be spent on new equipment, weapons, and magical elixirs.\nGame Features:\nÃ¢Ëœâ€¦ Legendary indirect control strategy totally adapted for Android\nÃ¢Ëœâ€¦ 10 types of heroes with dozens of statistics, weapons and armour\nÃ¢Ëœâ€¦ A dozen types of monsters\nÃ¢Ëœâ€¦ Several dozen spells\nÃ¢Ëœâ€¦ 30 upgradeable building types\nÃ¢Ëœâ€¦ 16 scenario missions\nÃ¢Ëœâ€¦ 3 difficulty levels\nÃ¢Ëœâ€¦ About 100 game achievements\nÃ¢Ëœâ€¦ Skirmish Mode","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c6741f449015e63c5a1261ba71fb6b9ad43f9cd","amp;dn":"Majesty+Kingdom","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c6741f449015e63c5a1261ba71fb6b9ad43f9cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,103,65,244,73,1,94,99,197,161,38,27,167,31,182,185,173,67,249,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
