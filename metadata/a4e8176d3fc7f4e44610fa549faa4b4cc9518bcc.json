Luther and Freddi head to the town square, in search of clues to find the rustlers. While in Saltwater Stella's Soda Saloon, they stumble upon their first clue - a note with a secret combination on it. Freddi and Luther figure this must be important, so they must investigate where the combination is. After checking the town square out a bit (or getting some help from Saltwater Stella) they find an abandoned ship with a huge lock on the metal door and a combination required. After entering the combination, they meet up with the first rustler, a slim fish dressed in ' what the well dressed rustlers are wearing. ' He then says since Freddi and Luther aren't wearing these things, they mustn't be rustlers. The rustlers are seriously fashion-cautious, so they won't accept Freddi and Luther until they have the proper attire. Freddi and Luther must search all over in order to find a ten gallon hat, (dyed a different color each game) a belt and a belt buckle, (different letter each game) and either a handerkechief or a bowtie accessory. Then, they can get in in order to liberate the hogfish. Finally, Luther and Freddi need to find out who the mysterious Mr. Big is. (Mr. Big could be anyone of the townsfolk who had the idea of hog-napping) In the end, the rustlers get to get their dream job - hogfish ranching. (they are now helping out at Cousin Calico's Ranch) During the credits, Freddi Fish and Luther sing &quot;Home On The Range.&quot;\n\nReleased : March 1999\n\nThis used to be my absolute favorite PC game when I was a kid. Hope you guys enjoy and seed! :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4e8176d3fc7f4e44610fa549faa4b4cc9518bcc","amp;dn":"Freddi+Fish+4%3A+The+Hogfish+Rustlers+of+Briny+Gulch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4e8176d3fc7f4e44610fa549faa4b4cc9518bcc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,232,23,109,63,199,244,228,70,16,250,84,159,170,75,76,201,81,139,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
