It aims to provide an easy way to carry out admin tasks on your computer, such as creating and editing the hard disk partitions. It comes with a lot of Linux software such as system tools and basic tools (editors, Midnight Commander, network tools). Exton|Defender can, however, also be used as a normal Linux Desktop System. It requires no installation, but can easily be installed to hard drive or to a USB stick. SYSTEM TOOLS INCLUDED NTFS-3g, GParted 0.10.0, PartImage 0.6.9, Shred 8.11, Sfdisk (util-linux-ng 2.19), Rsync 3.0.8, Ddrescue 1.14, FSArchiver 0.6.12 and Midnight Commander 4.7.5.2. Other programs (among many others): Wicd, Firefox 8.0, Gimp, Samba, Java Runtime Environment (JRE), Emacs and many compilation tools.\n...\nSPECAL FEATURES in version 111115 of Exton|Defender I have replaced SlackwareÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s 13.37 original kernel 2.6.37.6 with kernel 3.0.9-exton with support for 'everything'. All component software is upgraded to the latest version by now (20111115). Most importantly, however, is that I have arranged for all of your changes to the system to be saved even if you run Exton|Defender from disc (DVD) or USB stick. If you run Exton|Defender from a USB stick, all your changes can be saved directly on the stick. That will make you really portable. I have also arranged so this new version of Exton|Defender (111115) can be downloaded for free. NOTE that Exton|Defender advantageously shall be installed on a USB stick of at least 2 GB. The system is running really fast then and you won't hear the sound from CD/CD-ROM drive. Note also that, among other things, Exton|Defender 2012 can be seen as an alternative to Mandriva Flash (which costs 50 Euro). PASSWORDS The password for root (superuser) and live (normal user) is: root/live. \n... &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/exton-defender/files/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/exton-defender/files/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://defender.exton.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://defender.exton.net/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://linux.exton.net/english&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://linux.exton.net/english&lt;/a&gt;\n\nsha1sum : 8debb197a0baf60414283af7f261fe009f2efbc1  exton-defender-2012-1038mb-111115.iso\nmd5sum : e038fc1fc8c041d7ef143a838c9d485d  exton-defender-2012-1038mb-111115.iso","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64ab0668322cef093152bb6040969d5c0a67e6ab","amp;dn":"exton-defender-2012-1038mb-111115.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64ab0668322cef093152bb6040969d5c0a67e6ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,171,6,104,50,44,239,9,49,82,187,96,64,150,157,92,10,103,230,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
