Missions can be tackled by stealth, combat or a combination of both. Exploring levels opens new paths and alternatives for accomplishing mission goals, and it is possible to complete all missions and eliminate all of Attano's targets in a non-lethal manner. The story and missions are modified based on violent actions, or lack thereof, committed by the player. Magical abilities and equipment are designed to be combined to create new and varied effects.\n\nINSTALL NOTES:\n\n1.Install game - Open just Dishonored-=AviaRa.exe\n2.Play game from destktop shortcut\n\nNO NEED FOR CRACK\n\nStay at seed please\n\n\nMore info and support here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.aviara.ro/forum/index.php?topic=13531.0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.aviara.ro/forum/index.php?topic=13531.0&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b377b560aafaee5a3930c56a6e65fc1e5efd7a93","amp;dn":"Dishonored-%3DAviaRa%3D-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b377b560aafaee5a3930c56a6e65fc1e5efd7a93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,119,181,96,170,250,238,90,57,48,197,106,110,101,252,30,94,253,122,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
