So I'm only happy to do so. I've made a non-subbed, a English subbed, and a Spanish subbed version. They're all uploaded here. The size of the movies are quite small. only 700MB, and quality is OK, although some quality loss to save bandwidth for dial-ups and such must be calculated with. The frame rate is 23,976923 (?), and the resolution 720X406 so it should play in most stand-alone XviD-compatible players.\nCover art and conversion log are included in the torrent.\n\nHere's IndianChristian's original description etc:\n\n========================\n\nCutback (Christian Movie)   \n\nCUTBACK is the story of Luke, a high school senior who must come to grips with belief in God when he loses his best friend. Luke is an avid surfer and hopes to surf professionally. However, his father wants him to go to college; something Luke does not want to do.  When Luke is grounded for being drunk at a party, he ends up at a local church youth group where he meets Emily. Luke takes his best friend and sidekick Casey to the group as well. Casey admits that he believes in Jesus just before tragedy strikes. Luke lashes out at God but admits that he doesn't know where he would be if he had not survived the crash.  Luke gives his life to Jesus and begins to grow one day at a time closer to God.   The movie is very well acted and moves along with a strong Christian message.It is a well-crafted movie that all teenagers should see. It contains zero violence, bad language or nudity. A totally family safe movie.  Runtime: 87 mins Language: English Year: 2011 My Rating: 9/10 Quality: 10/10  Format: VOB format (unrar the .iso file using winrar or write to DVD)  \n\n****************************************************************************\n\n A Request:  I have got several requests for this movie, many of them here from India. There are many people who are downloading these movies over a 128 kbps dial up connection. So for  them downloading a 4.3 GB movie like this will be an issue. Would request anyone who is having a latest PC to convert it to avi/divx format and share the movie, so that our less fortunate brethren can download and watch it. I am having an older 1.2 GHZ Celeron processor with 512 MB RAM, so cannot convert it.  \n\n***************************************************************************** \n\n I would ask every Christian to do 2 things.\n\n1. If possible please buy this movie. Do you know that there are 2.2 billion Christians on earth today. But only a privileged few, around 12% have the means and the accessibility to buy Christian films.\nMany Christians are too poor to buy movies or live in places where Christian films are not available.\nThat's not all. Out of the 12% who have the means and accessibility to buy Christian media, only around 0.5% ever buys a Christian movie. In other words only 1 out of 200 Christians ever buys a Christian movie. Pathetic isn't it.\n\n2. Please seed the movies. If possible make copies and distribute to your poor neighbors. And please do pray for the movie makers and their families.  Remember the Kingdom of Heaven is in you and so is the choice of Heaven/Hell.

He has done all he could. Tell me what you can do for Christ?&quot;\n\nUploaded by Indian Christian\n\n============================\n\nSo there you have it.
