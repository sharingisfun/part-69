To begin my life with the beginning of my life, I record that I was born (as I have been informed and believe) on a Friday, at twelve o'clock at night. It was remarked that the clock began to strike, and I began to cry, simultaneously.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nAs a prolific 19th Century author of short stories, plays, novellas, novels, fiction and non, during his lifetime Dickens became known the world over for his remarkable characters, his mastery of prose in the telling of their lives, and his depictions of the social classes, mores and values of his times. Some considered him the spokesman for the poor, for he definitely brought much awareness to their plight, the downtrodden and the have-nots. He had his share of critics like Virginia Woolf and Henry James, but also many admirers, even into the 21st Century.\n\nOne of DickensÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most popular novels, Oliver Twist is the story of a young orphan who dares to say, &quot;Please, sir, I want some more.&quot; After escaping from the dark and dismal workhouse where he was born, Oliver finds himself on the mean streets of Victorian-era London and is unwittingly recruited into a scabrous gang of scheming urchins. In this band of petty thieves Oliver encounters the extraordinary and vibrant characters who have captured readersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ imaginations for more than 150 years: the loathsome Fagin, the beautiful and tragic Nancy, the crafty Artful Dodger, and perhaps one of the greatest villains of all timeÃ¢â‚¬â€the terrifying Bill Sikes. Rife with DickensÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disturbing descriptions of street life, the novel is buoyed by the purity of the orphan Oliver. Though he is treated with cruelty and surrounded by coarseness for most of his life, his pious innocence leads him at last to salvationÃ¢â‚¬â€and the shocking discovery of his true identity.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:186f8e4f727252583291cb32835f1083b0a8fb7a","amp;dn":"Oliver+Twist+by+Charles+Dickens+%5BrepublicV%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"186f8e4f727252583291cb32835f1083b0a8fb7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,111,142,79,114,114,82,88,50,145,203,50,131,95,16,131,176,168,251,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
