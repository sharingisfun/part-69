It contains all the applications you need: a web browser, an office suite, media apps, an instant messaging client and many more. It's based on KDE Plasma desktop and KDE software. This is a Long Term Support release.\n\n\n\nKubuntu 12.10 Highlights\n\n\n1GB Images\n\nWe're bursting out of our increasingly limited CD-sized images. The 12.10 images need to be installed from a DVD or USB drive.

Okular document viewer and Gwenview image browser both also see added functionality and improvements.\n\n\nNew Software Selections\n\nWe have added some new software to the default setup.\n\nCalligra Suite\nWe have added two world class apps from KDE's creativity suite.
