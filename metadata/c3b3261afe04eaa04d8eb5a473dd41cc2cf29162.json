The Economy when in rough shape just makes people more honest. They are more likely to their opinions and beliefs and less polite the fact there are so many Muslims burning cars, assaulting, raping and just generally being a good Muslim is the reason Anti-Muslim feelings are on the rise........\n\nThe 20 Swedish Democrats - the first national lawmakers from a party initially spawned in the 1980s by white supremacists - are working to impose a moratorium on new mosques, ban the shroud-like coverings worn by some conservative Muslim women and largely halt immigration from predominantly Muslim nations. \n\nAlarm over the anti-immigrant wave intensified recently as authorities warned &quot;dark-skinned&quot; residents in the southern city of Malmo that one or more snipers are targeting immigrants, killing one and wounding eight in 15 separate shootings this year. \n\n\n\n&quot;The Swedish are tired of walking around in their own neighborhoods and feeling like they're in Saudi Arabia,&quot; said Ekeroth, an intense 30-year-old and founder of the new Anti-Islamic Fund, which promotes criticism of radical Islam. &quot;It is time for the Swedish to be comfortable again in their own country.&quot; \n\nAt the same time, resentment is brewing in nations like Sweden over a rising tide of Muslim immigrants and the reluctance of some to adopt local customs, testing the limits of tolerance in some of the world's most open-minded societies. \n\nUnlike in the United States, European angst is increasingly focused on waves of Muslims - Turks, Iraqis, Somalis and others - who have become the hottest-button issue in recent elections. In Austria this month, the far-right Freedom Party made massive gains in regional elections after an anti-immigrant campaign that included a &quot;Bye Bye Mosque&quot; Internet game. It allowed players to target virtual minarets in elegant Vienna and pastoral Alpine villages with a single word: &quot;stop.&quot; \n\n\nThe long-liberal lands of Scandinavia and the Netherlands are also seeing a nationalist party renaissance. Last week, a conservative Dutch government came to power with the support of the anti-Islamic party of Geert Wilders, who is standing trial on a charge of inciting racial hatred against Muslims. In exchange for his support, Wilders extracted promises that the new government would take dramatic steps to curb immigration and follow the French in banning full-length Muslim veils. \n\nIn recent months, right-wing and nationalist parties have also consolidated or are now poised to expand their power in Denmark, Norway and Finland. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3b3261afe04eaa04d8eb5a473dd41cc2cf29162","amp;dn":"Anti-Immigration+Feelings+Sweep+Across+Europe.flv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3b3261afe04eaa04d8eb5a473dd41cc2cf29162","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,179,38,26,254,4,234,160,77,142,181,164,115,221,65,204,44,242,145,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
