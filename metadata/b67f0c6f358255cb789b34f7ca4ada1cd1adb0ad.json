Economists David Henderson and Sallie James explain why it's wrong.\n\nSuper-Pacs are evil. Undecided voters are idiots.\n\nIra Stoll from the Future of Capitalism blog and Reason Magazine editor-in-chief Matt Welch defend outside money in politics and undecided voters.\n\nPolls aren't accurate.\n\nI will challenge Scott Rasmussen about the accuracy and fairness of his polls.\n\nFinally, I'll explain how I ripped you off to pay for my beach house.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b67f0c6f358255cb789b34f7ca4ada1cd1adb0ad","amp;dn":"20121104-Stossel-%5BDisaster+and+Election+Myths%5D.Fox+Business.CF.a","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b67f0c6f358255cb789b34f7ca4ada1cd1adb0ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,127,12,111,53,130,85,203,120,155,52,247,202,74,218,28,209,173,176,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
