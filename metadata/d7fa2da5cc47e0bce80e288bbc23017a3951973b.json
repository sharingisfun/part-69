These values gained prominence in China over other doctrines, such as Legalism or Taoism during the Han Dynasty (206 BC ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ AD 220). Confucius' thoughts have been developed into a system of philosophy known as Confucianism Because no texts are demonstrably authored by Confucius, and the ideas most closely associated with him were elaborated in writings that accumulated over the period between his death and the foundation of the first Chinese empire in 221 BC, many scholars are very cautious about attributing specific assertions to Confucius himself. His teachings may be found in the Analects of Confucius, a collection of aphorisms, which was compiled many years after his death. For nearly 2,000 years he was thought to be the editor or author of all the Five Classics such as the Classic of Rites and the Spring and Autumn Annals \nConfucius' principles had a basis in common Chinese tradition and belief. He championed strong familial loyalty, ancestor worship, respect of elders by their children (and, according to later interpreters, of husbands by their wives), and the family as a basis for an ideal government. He expressed the well-known principle, &quot;Do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself&quot;, one of the earlier versions of the Golden Rule\n\n\nVideo Codec\t\tDIVX\nVideo Quality\t\tHIGH\nFrame rate\t\t30.0 fps\n\nAudio Codec\t\tMP3\nAudio Quality\t\t128 kbps\nAudio Channel\t2 Channels Stereo\nSample Rate\t\t44100 Hz\n\nFrame width\t\t1280\nFrame height\t\t544\nData rate\t\t200 kbps\nTotal bitrate\t\t328 kbps\nFrame rate\t\t30 frames/second\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7fa2da5cc47e0bce80e288bbc23017a3951973b","amp;dn":"Confucius.2010.720p.English+subtitled+by+CBCS.SH%40R.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7fa2da5cc47e0bce80e288bbc23017a3951973b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,250,45,165,204,71,224,188,232,14,40,139,188,35,1,122,57,81,151,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
