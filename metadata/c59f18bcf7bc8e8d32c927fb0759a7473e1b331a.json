This week, I report on:\n\nColleges that ban students from speaking their minds and restrict professors from free expression.\n\nNPR, which takes government funding, canned Juan Williams for being honest on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“The O'Reilly Factor'.\n\nAnd busybody politicians, who pass campaign finance &quot;reform&quot; laws that actually limit your free speech.\n\nWe should have vigorous, contentious debate about everything. And that includes topics that make people uncomfortable.\n\nFree speech, and its enemies. That's our show this week.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c59f18bcf7bc8e8d32c927fb0759a7473e1b331a","amp;dn":"20111117-Stossel-%5BEnemies+of+Free+Speech%5D-Fox+Business.CF.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c59f18bcf7bc8e8d32c927fb0759a7473e1b331a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,159,24,188,247,188,142,141,50,201,39,251,7,89,167,71,62,27,51,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
