The island is divided up between the six players, and you must try to capture your enemies' land and link up your own territories to create larger and stronger ones.\n\nYou begin capturing land by attacking with your peasants. Once your territories become richer you can combine peasants to make stronger and stronger people (Spearmen, Knights and then Barons) who can kill weaker enemy troops, or knock down their castles. Just be careful that you don't create too many expensive men or the territory will go bankrupt!\n\n\nWhat's in this version : (Updated : Sep 21, 2012)\n\n    Force close issue fixed.\n    Surrendered island fix.\n    better animation.\n    Bug fix release\n\nRequired Android O/S : 2.2+\n\n\n\n                                By bobiras2009\t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa285dd07cbfa5d558d4f71e440bc03141a0cc29","amp;dn":"Slay+v1.0.3+Final+By+bobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa285dd07cbfa5d558d4f71e440bc03141a0cc29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,40,93,208,124,191,165,213,88,212,247,30,68,11,192,49,65,160,204,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
