Chaos and Confusion is a documentary of the apostasy that is presently at work within the modern church.\nA Megiddo Films Production\nProduced, Written and Directed by Paul Flynn\nRunning Time: 2.5 hours\nwww.megiddofilms.org\n\n&quot;For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.&quot;\n~1 Corinthians 14:33\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nA Covenant for Civility: Come Let Us Reason Together:\nBeware of false teachings occurring these days which will bring about the rise of the anti-christ.  The UN has always had as its goal a one-world government and a one-world religion.  The strategy is to create an &quot;inclusive&quot; religion where all gods are equal; which means that none are the God of Israel.  Those who won't join this inclusive religion will be viewed as outsiders, hateful, rigid, etc.  This &quot;Covenant for Civility&quot; is another tool for that. It sounds good on the surface...and who wants to be uncivil....but who gets to decide what &quot;civil&quot; is? Our God has his ideas written down for millennia and they don't seem to want to follow those rules for being &quot;civil&quot;\n\nAs of April 2010, this &quot;covenant for civility,&quot; signed by over 100 &quot;faith leaders&quot; and publicized by Jim Wallis and Sojourners, practically begs for a contrarian response devoid of all truth and sugar. From the smarmy (not to mention insider-y) centrism of the subtitle (&quot;Come, let us reason together,&quot; a misapplication of Isaiah if there ever was one), to the more-in-sadness-than-in-anger a historical fretting about what has happened to American political discourse, the project fairly cries out for a sound thumping by the very contemptuous churls it seeks to corral.\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n \nSeed long and Prosper with Blessings from our Father. I have prayed to The Father, Bless all that Seed Long. (I have 4 year old active seeds out there, must be working for some folks!)\n\nEphesians 5:11\n11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove (expose) them.\n\n\n                                           \n\n      :thankyou:    :thankyou:     Thank You JESUS  \n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17e8eac327820e5d7c0ab6d1144f612156d3d5e3","amp;dn":"POtHS+-+Apostasy+The+Great+Falling+Away+Vol+10+-+Of+Chaos+and+Co","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17e8eac327820e5d7c0ab6d1144f612156d3d5e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,232,234,195,39,130,14,93,124,10,182,209,20,79,97,33,86,211,213,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
