The HD versions are meant for tablets, although they will work on phones. Do note though, that an HD version on 99% of phones will look the same as the regular version, but the HD version will have a smaller UI. All games included are the paid versions, except Bad Piggies which only has a free version. To remedy this, I've included Lucky Patcher which you can use to get rid of the adds in Bad Piggies.\n\nThe survival of the Angry Birds is at stake! Dish out revenge on the green pigs who stole the BirdsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ eggs. Use the unique destructive powers of the Angry Birds to lay waste to the pigsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ fortified castles.
