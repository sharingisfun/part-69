ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an exciting and creative concept that addresses the insights gleaned from our research in a very innovative way, adding that the animations would create a more demographically accessible face for McLaren.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce1647c4271ff904abf9021934eb8bd9e872d780","amp;dn":"McLaren+Animation+Tooned+Episode+2+Slicks.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce1647c4271ff904abf9021934eb8bd9e872d780","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,22,71,196,39,31,249,4,171,249,2,25,52,235,139,217,232,114,215,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
