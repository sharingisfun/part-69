He had a show on Food Network called &quot;Taste&quot;.  I don't know what happened between David and Food Network, but all of a sudden his show was gone, and aside from a few recipes he is gone off of the FN site.\n\nThere is no IMDB page for Taste, so I don't know how many episodes there are, but I present the only two I have.  The other video is &quot;In Food Today&quot; which was hosted by David Rosengarten and Donna Hanover.  The shows are taken from old VHS tapes, so the quality is not perfect.\n\nIf anyone has any other episodes of Taste (or other classic FN shows) please share.  If there is any interest in these classic FN shows, I also have quite a few episodes of &quot;Two Fat Ladies&quot; from the same era that I would be glad to share.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13e8143f1ac4c986253db45d529a3769b0bdc904","amp;dn":"Food+Network+-+Taste+-+David+Rosengarten+-+In+Food+Today","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13e8143f1ac4c986253db45d529a3769b0bdc904","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,232,20,63,26,196,201,134,37,61,180,93,82,154,55,105,176,189,201,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
