Secret Files 3 brings great and diversified puzzles (although easy for seasoned adventure gamers) and again mixes a fictitious story with real historical events. Even the mini games are fitting in and leave you the choice of two levels of difficulty. Orchestration, dramatic and cinematic presentation in Secret Files 3 are great and the game even provides several playable characters also as endings - depending on the decisions you make. Although the game lacks optimization of animations and the graphic presentation is getting kind of outdated due to the age of the engine, the game still looks pretty good. Overall it's quite a recommendation for all adventure gamers. \n\n\n\n\nThe complete walkthrough PDF/ Strategy Guide of the game &quot;SECRET FILES 3&quot; for PC.\n\nThis guide is in the form of a PDF file that can be opened in any pdf reader like \nFoxit PDF\n\n\n&quot;Salutes from India&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e550511e5b1471a9a29cafc69a6247fc833589e8","amp;dn":"Secret+Files+3+Complete+Walkthrough+Guide","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e550511e5b1471a9a29cafc69a6247fc833589e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,80,81,30,91,20,113,169,162,156,175,198,154,98,71,252,131,53,137,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
