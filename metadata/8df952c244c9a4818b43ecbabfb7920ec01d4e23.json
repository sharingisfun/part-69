In addition to all features in the free version, Battery Widget+ supports StylePack, which provides extra styles for battery level indicator icons.\n\nBattery Widget is an elegant 1x1 widget which shows you the battery level on your home screen, with some nice animation when charging. Tapping on it will show more battery information with a shortcut to view battery use.\n\nIn case you don't have enough space in your home screen, a clear battery level indicator is available on status bar so that you can see it even when you are browsing the web or sending text messages. It can be configured to show in 3 different colors to reflect high/medium/low battery levels. You can also define your own alerts, so that Battery Widget will automatically notify you about battery status changes.\n\nBattery Widget will not drain your battery, as it does only what it needs to do. When the device is idle, it is not listening to any battery information updates from the system if there are no active alerts. If there are active alerts, it just does minimal job to check if it needs to notify you and nothing more - it does not update any visible components when the handset is not in use. With this mechanism, Battery Widget consumes only little computation power and battery.\n\nAvailable in multiple languages: English, Chinese (Traditional), Chinese (Simplified), Japanese, Korean, Spanish, Russian, Greek, Italian, Hungarian, Estonian, Turkish, French, German, Brazilian Portuguese and Polish.\nPlease email me if you could help me with localizing Battery Widget.\n\nFeatures:\n\n    Battery level indicator on status bar, showing in different colors in 3 configurable level ranges\n    Alerts for various battery statuses\n    Time information when device is plugged/unplugged\n    Option to disable charging animation\n    Option to show temperature in Fahrenheit\n    Various indicator icon styles\n\nWhat's in this version: (Updated : Sep 19, 2012 )\n\n    Support for app language selection\n    Hiding invalid voltage level reported by system\n    Ukrainian language support\n   \n\nRequired Android O/S : 2.1+\n\n\n                                By bobiras2009\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8df952c244c9a4818b43ecbabfb7920ec01d4e23","amp;dn":"Battery+Widget%2B+v1.2.1+Final+By+bobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8df952c244c9a4818b43ecbabfb7920ec01d4e23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,249,82,194,68,201,164,129,139,67,236,186,191,183,146,14,192,29,78,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
