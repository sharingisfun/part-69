It was directed and co-written by Saverio Costanzo and shot in Calabria rather than Israel because of security reasons. Perhaps inevitably bleak and grueling, &quot;Private&quot; is also involving and provocative Ã¢â‚¬â€ and critical of Israeli treatment of Palestinians in an effectively understated manner.\n\nRip Specs\n\nFile Name .........................................: Private.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 731,824,128 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:28:39\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD 1.0.3\nFrame Size ......................................: 608x320 (AR: 1.900)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 935 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.192 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 153 kb/s [2 channel(s)] VBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n\nIMDB\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0420090/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0420090/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSpoken Languages and Subtitles\n\nArabic, Hebrew, English audio - one channel\n\nEnglish, French, Spanish, Dutch and Portuguese subtitles (srt)\n\nSaverio Costanzo - Private (2004)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4da810cd608ef5c649fd6aaee9d13d03cd852d0a","amp;dn":"Saverio+Costanzo+-+Private+%282004%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4da810cd608ef5c649fd6aaee9d13d03cd852d0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,168,16,205,96,142,245,198,73,253,106,174,233,209,61,3,205,133,45,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
