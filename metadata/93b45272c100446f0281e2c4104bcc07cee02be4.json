Written by leading scientists from around the world, Encyclopedia of Biological Invasions addresses all aspects of this subject at a global level--including invasions by animals, plants, fungi, and bacteria--in succinct, alphabetically arranged articles. Scientifically uncompromising, yet clearly written and free of jargon, the volume encompasses fields of study including biology, demography, geography, ecology, evolution, sociology, and natural history. Featuring many cross-references, suggestions for further reading, illustrations, an appendix of the world's worst 100 invasive species, a glossary, and more, this is an essential reference for anyone who needs up-to-date information on this important topic.\nEncyclopedia of Biological Invasions features articles on:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Well-known invasive species such the zebra mussel, chestnut blight, cheatgrass, gypsy moth, Nile perch, giant African snail, and Norway rat\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Regions with especially large numbers of introduced species including the Great Lakes, Mediterranean Sea, Hawaiian Islands, Australia, and New Zealand.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Conservation, ecological, economic, and human and animal health impacts of invasions around the world\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ The processes and pathways involved in invasion\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Management of introduced species\n\ncover &lt;a href=&quot; http://img22.imageshack.us/img22/6947/encyclopediaofbiologica.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://img22.imageshack.us/img22/6947/encyclopediaofbiologica.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93b45272c100446f0281e2c4104bcc07cee02be4","amp;dn":"Encyclopedia+of+Biological+Invasions+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93b45272c100446f0281e2c4104bcc07cee02be4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,180,82,114,193,0,68,111,2,129,226,196,16,75,204,7,206,224,43,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
