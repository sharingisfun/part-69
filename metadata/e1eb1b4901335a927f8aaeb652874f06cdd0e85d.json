The result? Poverty decreased...and then stopped decreasing.\n\nU.S. poverty rate 1959-2010 [graphic omitted]\n\nAlso, America will soon be bankrupt.\n\nMy show this week is about changing course.\n\nCongressman Jim Jordan, chairman of the Republican Study Committee, has a plan to reform welfare. Dan Epstein of the taxpayer watchdog group Cause of Action says a &quot;poverty industry&quot; funnels taxpayer dollars to politically connected groups, even the supposedly defunded ACORN.\n\nNYC Human Resources Administration boss Robert Doar oversees 15,000 government workers who try to address poverty in my town. He says that tying work requirements to benefits will help people become self-sufficient. But when I sent my former intern Zoelle Mallenbaum to a city job center, Doar's bureaucrats seemed more interested in signing her up for food stamps or unemployment benefits than helping her find work.\n\nTom Palmer, editor of &quot;After the Welfare State,&quot; says young people must save for their own future because the money promised them by politicians will be long gone by the time they retire.\n\nSo is there an alternative to America's welfare state? Michael Strong works to create alternatives. He has helped establish a &quot;free city&quot; in Honduras that will have minimal taxes and limited government, where people will be better able to prosper.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1eb1b4901335a927f8aaeb652874f06cdd0e85d","amp;dn":"20121004-Stossel-%5BAfter+the+Welfare+State%5D.Fox+Business.CF.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1eb1b4901335a927f8aaeb652874f06cdd0e85d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,235,27,73,1,51,90,146,127,138,174,182,82,135,79,6,205,208,232,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
