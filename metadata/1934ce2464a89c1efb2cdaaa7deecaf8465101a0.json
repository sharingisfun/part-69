Without consulting Wilder, Paramount Pictures executive Y. Frank Freeman changed the title to The Big Carnival just prior to its release. Early television broadcasts retained that title, but when aired by Turner Classic Movies -- and when released on DVD by The Criterion Collection in July 2007ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½it reverted to Ace in the Hole.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043338/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043338/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_in_the_Hole_%28film%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_in_the_Hole_%28film%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnjoy.
