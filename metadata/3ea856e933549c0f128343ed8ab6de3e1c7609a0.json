Dionne (Senior Fellow at The Brookings Institution and Washington Post columnist), looked at Romney's style versus the president's substance.\n\nPresident Obama said we can't double down on the policies that created the Great Recession. Ed welcomed David Cay Johnston (Pulitzer Prize winning journalist and author of &quot;The Fine Print: How Big Companies Use 'Plain English' To Rob You Blind&quot;), to examine Romney's $5 trillion lie.\n\n\nAll of a sudden Mitt Romney is concerned for the middle-class.  James Hoffa (President of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters), reacted to Romney's pandering to the middle class.\n\nEd brought the latest on Mitt Romney's plan to fry Big Bird!\n\nAnd in the Big Finish, Ohio is the key to victory for both candidates. Ed asked state Sen. Nina Turner (D-OH) whether last night's debate was a game changer for voters in her state.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ea856e933549c0f128343ed8ab6de3e1c7609a0","amp;dn":"The+Ed+Show+10-4-12.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ea856e933549c0f128343ed8ab6de3e1c7609a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,168,86,233,51,84,156,15,18,131,67,237,138,182,222,62,28,118,9,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
