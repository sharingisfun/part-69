To make this pack a tradeoff between quality and\nsize, I have used Adobe Audition to create music with a target\nbitrate of 192 in ogg Vorbis format.  The OST has superior \naudio quality to PSF and the original game.\n\nFinal Fantasy VIII came with midi only and no way to use stream\ndata like ogg Vorbis.  For this reason I have also created a DLL\ncalled RaW, coded in Delphi 7, to play the music in the game \nusing bass.dll.  \n\nThe DLL loads automatically on game start via Aali's driver.\nThe DLL supports all known languages of Final Fantasy VIII","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:baa2fdc02b9546240f0eb3c2c9a08e490c08f67c","amp;dn":"Roses+and+Wine+Final+Fantasy+8+Music","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"baa2fdc02b9546240f0eb3c2c9a08e490c08f67c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,162,253,192,43,149,70,36,15,14,179,194,201,160,142,73,12,8,246,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
