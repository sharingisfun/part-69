Speaking to our level of comprehension, from their present moment to our now, through a series of loving, allowing, brilliant yet comprehensively simple, recordings in print and in sound -- they guide us to a clear connection with our Inner Being -- they guide us to self-upliftment from our total self. \n\nCheck out Abraham for yourself. It's the only way to go and the only way to know. \n\nLaw of Attraction says, &quot;That which is like unto itself is drawn.&quot; Everything is valid and everything is truthful, because Law of Attraction lets everything be. The thrill of the ride is carved out of the contrast. Without the contrast, you could not decide.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e87ed19b37f071688d6a23bd97026ef91a7512d2","amp;dn":"Abraham-Hicks+2012-06-16+Video%2Bmp3+LIVE+3-hr+Broadcast","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e87ed19b37f071688d6a23bd97026ef91a7512d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,126,209,155,55,240,113,104,141,106,35,189,151,2,110,249,26,117,18,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
