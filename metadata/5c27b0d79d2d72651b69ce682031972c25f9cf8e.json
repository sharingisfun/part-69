Powell calls himself a republican. NO real republican with real republican values could ever endorse Obama---he is as far left as they come. It does not make sense. If you're going to vote for Obama, you cannot call yourself a republican. So OF COURSE Powell endorsed Obama simply because he's black!  And really, when 90+% of blacks vote for Obama, that's also very clearly votes based on skin color. I'm all about voting for a black person, or a purple person, or a striped person, as long as they share my values.\n\nRepublicans are not the racists here.\n\nObama would not be president if white people didn't vote for him.\nBut who cares. Sununu is right about Powell.
