Raw files are so named because they are not yet processed and therefore are not ready to be printed or edited with a bitmap graphics editor. There are dozens if not hundreds of raw formats in use by different models of digital equipment (like cameras or film scanners).\n\nRaw image files are sometimes called digital negatives, as they fulfill the same role as negatives in film photography: that is, the negative is not directly usable as an image, but has all of the information needed to create an image. Likewise, the process of converting a raw image file into a viewable format is sometimes called developing a raw image, by analogy with the film development process used to convert photographic film into viewable prints. The selection of the final choice of image rendering is part of the process of white balancing and color grading.\n\nInstall:\n\n- run application\n- apply patch","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87e2f7df1470e95c8719194a20bd8048f7543efd","amp;dn":"Light+Developer+7.1+build+12452","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87e2f7df1470e95c8719194a20bd8048f7543efd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,226,247,223,20,112,233,92,135,25,25,74,32,189,128,72,247,84,62,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
