Melbourne, 1886. Two gentlemen climb into a\nhansom cab late one murky night. One man climbs out, the other travels\non to St Kilda. On arrival, the driver finds the second man dead; murdered.\nThe high-society killing sends shockwaves through the young city, still flush\nfrom its gold-rush boom. The victim, Oliver Whyte (Brett Climo), fresh from\nEngland with glowing letters of introduction, had endeared himself to one of\nthe wealthiest men in the colony, Mark Frettlby (John Waters). It is Marks\n21-year-old daughter, Madge Frettlby (Jessica De Gouw), who Whyte instantly\nsets his sights on, but Madge is already in love with Brian Fitzgerald\n(Oliver Ackland), a sensitive, hard-working Irishman. \n.\nSource: The.Mystery.Of.A.Hansom.Cab.2012.PDTV.x264-W4F\nFormat: DVD-5\nVideo: 720x576\nAudio: English DD2.0\nSubtitles: Dutch (Hardcoded)\nNL Vertaling: QoQ TEAM - Cranedriver &amp; SK\n.\nEnjoy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97b4fdb606d5fb78ad5f4c8da65f6df7971cf4d6","amp;dn":"+The+Mystery+of+a+Hansom+Cab+%282012%29+HDTV2DVD+DD2.0+NL+Subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97b4fdb606d5fb78ad5f4c8da65f6df7971cf4d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,180,253,182,6,213,251,120,173,95,76,141,166,95,109,247,151,28,244,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
