The English subtitles cover only the non-English parts.  I haven't checked the copious other subtitles for aberrant behavior. Czech subs come in two varieties.\n\nA bit more subtle on the humor this time around. A strange hybrid &quot;mockumentary&quot;.  Hybrid in the sense that most of the subjects are played by themselves, and not really being &quot;in the know&quot;, I can't draw a line where the reality ends and the fiction starts. It centers around Jarek Nohavica and the Czech folk musicians &quot;Cechomor&quot; who are very real. \n\nSome odd insight into spontaneous combustion is included.\n\nThe extras do not appear to be subtitled.  There are, however, two versions (100 vs. 108 minutes)of the film, selectable on the menu.\n\nUncompressed DVD9 VIDEO_TS files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f81ccd5a7f322ff5fe53e56207f3a69335fe900","amp;dn":"Petr+Zelenka+and+his+friends+-+Year+of+the+Devil+%282002%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f81ccd5a7f322ff5fe53e56207f3a69335fe900","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,129,204,213,167,243,34,255,95,229,62,86,32,127,58,105,51,95,233,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
