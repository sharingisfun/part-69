It was also released for PlayStation and Nintendo 64 in early 2000. This game is part of Midway's 'Thunder' series of racing games, which includes Offroad Thunder, 4 Wheel Thunder, and Arctic Thunder. Hydro Thunder Hurricane a sequel to Hydro Thunder was later released for the Xbox 360 on July 27, 2010 on Xbox Live Arcade.\n\n\nThe game works. The only flaw I noticed so far was on the Shipwreck level, it lags a bit, but it's not really a big problem.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2cf44a6c34549b8d00776b09b1277ee7861be179","amp;dn":"%28PSX-PSP%29+Hydro+Thunder","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2cf44a6c34549b8d00776b09b1277ee7861be179","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,244,74,108,52,84,155,141,0,119,107,9,177,39,126,231,134,27,225,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
