Properly designed, Xsan networks enable organizations and users to maximize available RAID data storage, securely share large files across high-performance environments, and automatically fail over when hardware errors occur (using appropriate architecture).\n\nThe Xsan technology is particularly well suited to powering video post-production needs. Other environments in which the platform excels are broadcasting, any industry in which storage consolidation is important, mail-server clustering, and similarly demanding enterprise IT tasks.\n\nWhat components are required?\n\nA RAID storage system is among the first requirements. Promise VTrak E-Class RAID storage units fulfill the back-end RAID volume (also known as LUNs, for logical unit number) requirement, while a number of fibre-channel switches have been approved by Apple, including Brocade Silkworm 200E, 4100 and 4900; QLogis SANbox 2-64, 1400, 5200, 9100 and 9200 series; and CiscoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s MDS 9000 family.\n\nAn Xsan metadata controller servers as the SANÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“traffic cop,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ granting client permissions and enabled read/write access to files. A Mac OS X client or Xserve server running Xsan can serve as metadata controller.\n\nXsan clients, such as those running Mac OS X, or Xserves running Xsan, can receive direct block-level access to SAN volume data. Even network clients connected to an Xserve running Mac OS Server and Xsan can access SAN data over traditional Ethernet networks using AFP, SMB/CIFs and NFS.\n\nController systems must be Mac Pro or Xserve systems powered by Intel CPUs with 2GB RAM and an Apple Fibre Channel card. Xsan can be installed on client computers running Mac OS X 10.5 or 10.6 and on servers running Mac OS X Server 10.5 or Mac OS X Server 10.6. Non-Mac client computers, including Windows and Linux systems, can be connected to Xsan networks using QuantumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s StorNext File System.\n\nHow scalable is Xsan?\n\nThere is no limit to the number of network client connections that can be implemented. Multiple RAID volumes can be shared (up to 16 according to Apple documentation), with support for billions of files per volume. Further, volumes can be as large as 2 petabytes (PB).\n\nWhat improvements are included in Xsan 2?\n\nApple has included many refinements in Xsan 2, including easier setup and deployment using Xsan Admin 2. Workstations and servers can now access multiple Xsan volumes simultaneously, thanks to improved MultiSAN support.\n\nSpotlight integration is now available across an Xsan SAN volume, as support for Cover Flow and Quick Look; these features make it easier for enterprise users to locate and access files and information stored across Xsan-powered networks. Xsan also now boasts integrated support for new Mac OS X server features, including Mail Server and Podcast Producer, which further enhances performance and scalability in large environments.\n\nWhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s it cost?\n\nXsan 2.2 costs $999 per license.\n\n\nXsan 2.2 Serials\n\nXSAN-020-000-R-JMS-7GG-PRX-LQM-SNR-LHR-H\n\n\nXSAN-020-000-R-JX9-SS3-D3V-LSJ-HBD-227-C\n\n\nXSAN-020-000-R-LWG-QLM-D3M-LQD-6DJ-VDX-2\n\n\nXSAN-020-000-R-JD9-HL2-R9Y-JZ8-G2L-LX3-H\n\n\nXSAN-020-000-R-L96-F9G-PR3-LRL-WHN-49Z-J\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:412e8d0c451677b350ced9ed7393763fdee8c150","amp;dn":"Xsan+2.2+Install+Disc.dmg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"412e8d0c451677b350ced9ed7393763fdee8c150","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,46,141,12,69,22,119,179,80,206,217,237,115,147,118,63,222,232,193,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
