Later Tuesday evening, protesters in Libya burned down the U.S. consulate in the Libyan city of Benghazi, killing the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three members of his staff.\n       The 14-minute video is a trailer to an amateurish, low-budget movie titled &quot;Innocence of Muslims,'' which depicts Muhammad as a feckless philanderer who approved of child sexual abuse. Muslims find it offensive to depict Muhammad in any manner, let alone insult the prophet.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9712e255924165176339303044f7ff0342cd1a4","amp;dn":"Muhammad+Movie+Trailer.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9712e255924165176339303044f7ff0342cd1a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,113,46,37,89,36,22,81,118,51,147,3,4,79,127,240,52,44,209,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
