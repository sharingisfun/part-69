Jeremiah Wright, that the U.S. government shortchanged Hurricane Katrina victims because of racism.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The people down in New Orleans they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t care about as much!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Obama shouts in the video, which was shot in June of 2007 at Hampton University in Virginia. By contrast, survivors of Sept. 11 and Hurricane Andrew received generous amounts of aid, Obama explains. The reason? Unlike residents of majority-black New Orleans, the federal government considers those victims Ã¢â‚¬Å“part of the American family.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe racially charged and at times angry speech undermines ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s carefully-crafted image as a leader eager to build bridges between ethnic groups. For nearly 40 minutes, using an accent he almost never adopts in public, Obama describes a racist, zero-sum society, in which the white majority profits by exploiting black America. The mostly black audience shouts in agreement. The effect is closer to an Al Sharpton rally than a conventional campaign event.\n\nRead more: http://dailycaller.com/2012/10/02/obama-speech-jeremiah-wright-new-orleans/#ixzz28Pba0IMO\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b554f59451c10e5b89d02ec24a4ad0c7a0e5b080","amp;dn":"Obama+Speech+June+2007+at+Hampton+University.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b554f59451c10e5b89d02ec24a4ad0c7a0e5b080","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,84,245,148,81,193,14,91,137,208,46,194,74,74,208,199,160,229,176,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
