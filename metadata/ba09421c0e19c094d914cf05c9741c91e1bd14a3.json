Guide them through 30 deadly missions with varied objectives: destroy enemy armoured formations, save hostages and eliminate enemy generals, to name but just a few.\n\nYour troopers will face enemy infantry, snipers, ÃƒÂ¦technicals and even tanks. The casualty rate is going to be high but there's an endless supply of fresh recruits to step up and fill the ranks. Those lucky troopers who survive from mission to mission will be promoted, and each new stripe they gain makes them tougher.\n\nTo increase your troopers chances of survival, use Command Points to give them better equipment, reinforce their team with a specialist like machinegunner, medic or delta force and call in support drops during missions. War might be hell but this is the funniest way to fight in one!\n\nFeatures Tiny Troopers RIP : \n\n   - The safe way to fight in a war: you won't end up in a body bag. \n   - Lead your troopers in 30 deadly missions with varied objectives. \n   - Face enemies from infantry to snipers and tanks. \n   - Reinforce your squad with specialists like machine gunner, medic and delta force. \n   - Keep your troopers alive: they get better after each new rank they gain. \n   - War is hell but it can also be fun! \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba09421c0e19c094d914cf05c9741c91e1bd14a3","amp;dn":"Tiny_Troopers%5BPC%5D%5BEnglish%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba09421c0e19c094d914cf05c9741c91e1bd14a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,9,66,28,14,25,192,148,217,20,207,5,201,116,28,145,225,189,20,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
