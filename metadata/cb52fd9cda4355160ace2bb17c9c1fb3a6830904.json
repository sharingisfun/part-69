Facing the downside of middle age, a restless Bruce Wayne pacifies his frustration with racecars and liquor Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but the Bat still beckons as he watches his city fall prey to gangs of barbaric criminals known as The Mutants.The return of Harvey Dent as Two-Face finally prompts Wayne to once again don the Dark KnightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cowl, and his dramatic capture of the villain returns him to crime-fighting Ã¢â‚¬â€œ simultaneously making him the target of law enforcement and the new hope for a desolate Gotham City. Particularly inspired is a teenage girl named Carrie, who adopts the persona of Robin and ultimately saves Batman from a brutal attack by the Mutant leader. Armed with a new sidekick, and re-energized with a definitive purpose, the Dark Knight returns to protect Gotham from foes newÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ and old.Based on the Graphic Novel BATMAN: THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS by Frank Miller and Klaus Janson \n\nNFO: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nfomation.net/info/1347417376.Batman_The_Dark_Knight_Returns_Part_1_2012_DVDRip_x264-Ganool__NFO_.nfo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nfomation.net/info/1347417376.Batman_The_Dark_Knight_Returns_Part_1_2012_DVDRip_x264-Ganool__NFO_.nfo&lt;/a&gt;\n\nScreens: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.anonmgur.com/up/ce3bd9fe04c70a3b0320ac409b6062ad.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.anonmgur.com/up/ce3bd9fe04c70a3b0320ac409b6062ad.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCover: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://picturestack.com/417/782/BCoBatmanTheDpwN.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://picturestack.com/417/782/BCoBatmanTheDpwN.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb52fd9cda4355160ace2bb17c9c1fb3a6830904","amp;dn":"Batman+The+Dark+Knight+Returns+Part+I+x264+-+Ganool","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb52fd9cda4355160ace2bb17c9c1fb3a6830904","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,82,253,156,218,67,85,22,10,206,43,177,124,156,31,179,166,131,9,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
