UryÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â« declares himself an enemy of all Soul Reapers and challenges Ichigo to a competition of hunting hollows. \n\n12 \t&quot;A Gentle Right Arm&quot;\n\nThe contest between Ichigo and UryÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â« has lured hundreds of hollows into Karakura Town, endangering many of Ichigo's friends. Chad is forced to fight a hollow in order to save Karin. During the battle he is finally able to see the hollow clearly, and develops a new ability, an armored right arm capable of firing energy blasts. \n\n13 \t&quot;Flower and Hollow&quot;\n\nThe situation worsens as more hollows appear in the human world, attacking the school where Orihime and her friends are. While defending them, Orihime develops her own power, the Shun Shun Rikka, a group of fairy-like creatures coming from the hairpins given to her by her brother, and defeats the hollow. Afterward, Urahara takes in Orihime and Chad to help them with their new powers while Rukia and Ichigo confront UryÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â«. \n\n14 \t&quot;Back to Back, a Fight to the Death!&quot;\n\nThe legion of hollows force Ichigo and UryÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â« to team up in combat while the others watch. A giant hollow called a Menos Grande arrives on the scene, and is driven away after Ichigo inflicts a wound assisted by power from UryÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â«. However, he releases too much spiritual power in the process. The strain of his powers causes Ichigo to lose consciousness, and UryÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â« saves him by releasing the excess energy through his bow. \n\n15 \t&quot;Kon's Great Plan&quot;\n\nTired of mistreatment from Ichigo, Kon runs away to find a better owner. But he finds his abuse continuing from girls due to his freaky nature. Ichigo makes an effort to befriend UryÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â« but is rebuffed. Rukia becomes conflicted with her attachment with humans. Rather than endanger Ichigo, she runs away to face the newly-arrived hunters from the Soul Society.\n\nUploader Notes:\n===============\n\nUse VLC Player for best results.\n\nSeed and enjoy... :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f6cdcc6cb8d85ebb1f416bb4c4dfd36dca8f4ad","amp;dn":"Bleach+Ep.11-15+%28Eng.+Sub%29%5BSpeedy+Joe%5D%28480p%29%5BPirateBoyTPB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f6cdcc6cb8d85ebb1f416bb4c4dfd36dca8f4ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,108,220,198,203,141,133,235,177,244,22,187,76,77,253,54,220,168,244,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
