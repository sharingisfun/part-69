Then eventually picking up a bass player named Larry Eisenhower. They were notorious for their outlandish stage presence of just rocking out non stop, with the occasional smashing of a guitar or diving into an amp. They definitely knew how to play a show and pave the path for many other local bands and musicians in the central P.A. area.
