Her meticulous sketches of extant garments, coupled with her carefully drawn graphed patterns, make her books indispensible both for students of historical costumes and for those who wish to reproduce them. Each drawing includes a brief description of the garment, including which materials were used and any types of embellishment. I found it very easy to scale up the patterns I wanted to use with one-inch pattern graphing paper (available through most fabric outlets). This particular volume in the _Patterns of Fashion_ series includes my favorite era -- the English Regency. The patterns provided include long gowns, a crossover bodice shortgown (a version of which was made for Kate Winslet in &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;), a riding habit and a 1790s pelisse (overdress). This book is worth every penny and will become a dog-eared favorite on your costuming shelf!\nThis book goes into details that others leave out. What type of lining was used, how the embrodery was done, drawings of the hooks and eyes used to hold some garmets closed. Where many books on historical dress will tell you a garmet was laced closed up the back Janet Arnold will expand and tell you that the holes were reinforced with metal rings sewn on with thread and what color and type of thread. In addition, the clothing of the men of the time is not just given a passing nod, but every bit as important. Her attention to detail extends to giving the information on where she obtained her information, allowing yet more research to be done on your own. Not for anyone new to sewing but a must for the person who wants to understand the details of historical garmet construction.\n\n\n5) Metric Pattern Cutting for Women's Wear by Winifred Aldrich\n\nMetric Pattern Cutting for WomenÃ¢â‚¬Â²s Wear was first published in 1975 to provide a straightforward introductory book for students beginning courses in flat pattern cutting. The fifth edition continues to offer an introduction to the principles of pattern cutting, with a range of good basic blocks and examples of their application to garments. However, the great expansion of casual wear, cut in jersey or stretch fabrics, has led to the growth of Ã¢â‚¬Â²flat cuttingÃ¢â‚¬Â² with no darting to create the shape and this edition devotes a whole section to this type of cutting. The sections on computerÃ¢â‚¬â€œaided design and grading have been updated. The size charts of body measurements have been revised, reflecting the changing shape of womenÃ¢â‚¬Â²s bodies.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf8a9bd09e96632669c551c526cd2537f815fca8","amp;dn":"5+Patternmaking+books+by+Helen+Joseph+Armstrong%2C+Tomoko+Nakamich","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf8a9bd09e96632669c551c526cd2537f815fca8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,138,155,208,158,150,99,38,105,197,81,197,38,205,37,55,248,21,252,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
