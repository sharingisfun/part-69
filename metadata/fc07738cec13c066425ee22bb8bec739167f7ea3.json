In each episode the WotWots help children to celebrate and understand the diversity of the animal world. They recognise kindness and co-operation as core values, delight in learning new words and enjoy exploring their creativity through drawing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc07738cec13c066425ee22bb8bec739167f7ea3","amp;dn":"The+WotWots+-+Wotter+Otter","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc07738cec13c066425ee22bb8bec739167f7ea3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,7,115,140,236,19,192,102,66,94,226,43,184,190,199,57,22,127,126,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
