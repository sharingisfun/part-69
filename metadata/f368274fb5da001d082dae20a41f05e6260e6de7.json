It is also their first release on any label at all, in this case the Flip/Elektra label. &quot;Just Go&quot;, &quot;Mudshovel&quot;, and &quot;Home&quot; were released as singles. The song &quot;Mudshovel&quot; can also be found on their previous album, Tormented, albeit in a slightly different form; this version of the song goes under the title of &quot;Mudshuvel&quot;.
