Spielrain's psychological problems are deeply rooted in her childhood and violent father. She is highly intelligent however and hopes to be a doctor, eventually becoming a psychiatrist in her own right. The married Jung and Spielrein eventually become lovers. Jung and Freud develop an almost father-son relationship with Freud seeing the young Jung as his likely successor as the standard-bearer of his beliefs. A deep rift develops between them when Jung diverges from Freud's belief that while psychoanalysis can reveal the cause of psychological problems it cannot cure the patient.\n\n\n\nGreetings Realuploads","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46ed64bbcbddfb9ad159bb3a4394c4781907239f","amp;dn":"A+Dangerous+Method+%28+Nordic+subs+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46ed64bbcbddfb9ad159bb3a4394c4781907239f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,237,100,187,203,221,251,154,209,89,187,58,67,148,196,120,25,7,35,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
