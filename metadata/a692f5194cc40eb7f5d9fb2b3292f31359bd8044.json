Its not surprising that Hollywood felt it had to elaborate on the story when it made a major motion picture out of the property back in 1993. Unfortunately, this adaptation went wildly off course. You can read all about its chaotic production process in issue 221 of Game Informer, but if youd like to watch the train wreck for yourself, youd better take it with a spoonful of sugar or a spoonful of Game Informers sarcastic commentary. Join Game Informer editors Tim Turi, Jeff Marchiafava, Bryan Vore, and Ben Reeves as they power through Super Mario Bros. the movie.&quot;\n\n\n\nVideo Source: DVD Rip\n\n\nLength: 01:44:37\nFrame Width: 854\nFrame Height: 480\nData Rate: 7000kbps\nTotal Bitrate: 7128kbps\nFrame Rate: 29fps\nSize: 2.64 GB\n\n\nAudio: 128kbs\nChannels: 2(stereo)\nAudio Sample Rate: 48 khz\n\n\nPlease seed to at least a 1:1 ratio when your done downloading so that we can spread the torrent more efficiently.\n\nIf Game Informer starts do do more of these video game movie commentaries I will be releasing those as well so feedback on the quality of this file will be important for quality control in future release.\n\nUntil then, seed up me hearties, yo ho! \n\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a692f5194cc40eb7f5d9fb2b3292f31359bd8044","amp;dn":"Super+Mario+Bros+%281993%29+-+Game+Informer+Commentary+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a692f5194cc40eb7f5d9fb2b3292f31359bd8044","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,146,245,25,76,196,14,183,245,217,251,43,50,146,243,19,89,189,128,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
