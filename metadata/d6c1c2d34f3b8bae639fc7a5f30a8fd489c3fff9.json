Professional pickers Sheldon Smithens and Scott Cozens zipping around Armstrong, Abbotsford and Mission picking up Ã¢â‚¬Å“a cool collection of trolley ads, tin litho signs, atlases, and rare gas pumps,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ says the History Channel.The pair searches for antiques and collectibles in peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s basements, attics, sheds and barns Ã¢â‚¬â€œ then they bargain to buy those items to re-sell for a profit. The two have set a friendly wager to drive the episode forward: Ã¢â‚¬Å“the one who picks the most macho item wins a beer. When Sheldon finds a 1920s leather football helmet and Scott scoops up a vintage grip meter, both are convinced they have won the competition.\n\nNo HD source as of yet available.\n\nI uploaded this TV Rip that is watchable for all you Canadian Pickers fans until KILLERS comes out with their HD release.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6c1c2d34f3b8bae639fc7a5f30a8fd489c3fff9","amp;dn":"Canadian+Pickers+S03E05.Xvid.TvRip-BUZZARD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6c1c2d34f3b8bae639fc7a5f30a8fd489c3fff9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,193,194,211,79,59,139,174,99,159,199,165,243,10,143,212,137,195,255,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
