The film boasts an ensemble cast of leading art cinema actors of Parallel Cinema, including Vijaya Mehta, Manohar Singh, Om Puri, Naseeruddin Shah, and Rohini Hattangadi. It based on the play Party (1976) by Mahesh Elkunchwar.\nThe movie is produced by National Film Development Corporation of India (NFDC).\n\nPlot:\nThe Government of India has chosen to present a literary award to Divakar Barve in recognition of his contribution to Indian Arts and Cinema. Divakar accepts this award, and the community decides to recognize this award-recipient at a special party just for him. Several big-wigs in Bombay city are invited, and they include Mohini, the alcoholic and aging wife of Divakar; Ravi an actor; Bharat an aspiring actor and poet; An aging Ruth who is always accompanied by a much younger boyfriend; Poet and producer, Agashe; Ila Arun the singer; and Achyut Potdar a Bollywood actor. Everyone awaits the arrival of Amrit, an activist. What the invitees do not know that the party is going to be gate-crashed by the host's, Mrs. Damyanti Rane's son and his teen-aged friend; a couple, Naren and Malvika; Then something unexpected happens: Amrit does arrive - but not in the way everybody expected him to arrive. \n\nOverview:\nShot in real-time, lasting most of an evening, except for a few initial scenes to set the context Ã¢â‚¬â€ which show the people who attend just before going to the party: getting ready, looking forward to going, or cribbing about having to go Ã¢â‚¬â€ and a harrowing finale.\nThe film is a deeply intelligent satire aimed at the urban elite Ã¢â‚¬â€ especially those poseurs with artistic inclinations, namely establishment-artists and their patrons. It depicts their apathy towards the society at large while they get away, by the way of small talk and prosaic conversations at parties.\nThe power of the movie derives from Elkunchwar's play Ã¢â‚¬â€ which had a very successful run in Marathi theatres in Pune and Mumbai, before Govind Nihalani turned it, with the author's active participation, into a screenplay.\n\nAwards:\n1985 National Film Award for Best Supporting Actress: Rohini Hattangadi\n1985 Asia-Pacific Film Festival, Best Actress: Vijaya Mehta\n\nimdb link - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0248289/\n\nCast:\nManohar Singh\nVijaya Mehta\nRohini Hattangadi\nOm Puri\nNaseeruddin Shah\nDeepa Sahi\nAmrish Puri\nShafi Inamdar\nMohan Bhandari\nIla Arun\nSoni Razdan\nJayant Kripalani\nK.K.
