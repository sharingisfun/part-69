It's been some time since Irene (Schanelek) has seen her family, and after a brief stopover at home she decides to pay a visit to her bigoted brother Alex and her young son Konstantin. Konstantin lives with his uncle Alex, and strives to become a successful writer when he grows up. Before long, Irene also runs into next-door neighbor Agnes, who is currently spending summer break with her parents. Though Irene has recently taken a new lover, everything back home seems strangely stagnant yet decidedly different in a way she simply cannot pinpoint. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi\n\n\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English / French","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eebe0d72163666d90f7fe5b608be2d9521c3e0dc","amp;dn":"Nachmittag+aka+Afternoon+2007+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eebe0d72163666d90f7fe5b608be2d9521c3e0dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,190,13,114,22,54,102,217,15,127,229,182,8,190,45,149,33,195,224,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
