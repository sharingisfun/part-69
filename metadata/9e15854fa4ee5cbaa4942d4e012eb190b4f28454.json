Once the screen comes back on, it will allow CPU 1/2/3 back ONLINE.\n\nHow does it work?\nSince we have Dual &amp; Quad core CPUs, we have a CPU 0 and a CPU 1/2/3, core 0/1/2/3, while the screen is off we really only need to have 1 core active &quot;CPU0&quot;, this App will make sure CPU 1/2/3 shuts off while the screen is off, then resumes normal usage when the screen comes back on.\n\nCompatibility?\nWorks with any Dual Core &amp; Quad Core Devices!\n\nBattery Saving?\nBattery savings all depends on Usage &amp; idle times.\n\nWhat's in this version:\nVersion 3.7 Release Notes:\nGalaxy Nexus leankernel does not work with this app &amp; I recommend the Stock kernel if you wish to use this App.\n~ Everything is Fixed &amp; working via 3.7\n~ 3.7 Is now the Final Build!\n~ If you get Wake issues, it's likely a Kernel related issue, If you get these Issues try out Different Kernel setups.\n~ Clean Up of Theme &amp; Source\n~ Quad Core now working as intended\n~ Fixed the Threshold on Quad CPU's\nUser's Please Email me before rating if you have Issues!\n\n                                By bobiras2009\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e15854fa4ee5cbaa4942d4e012eb190b4f28454","amp;dn":"CPU+Sleeper+Dual+Core+v3.7+Final+By+bobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e15854fa4ee5cbaa4942d4e012eb190b4f28454","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,21,133,79,164,238,92,186,164,148,45,78,1,46,177,144,180,242,132,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
