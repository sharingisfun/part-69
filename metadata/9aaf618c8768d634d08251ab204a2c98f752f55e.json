Lee and Tiffany will star in the new reality based outdoor program, The Crush with Lee &amp; Tiffany on Outdoor Channel.\n\nNot only do Lee and Tiffany regularly tag some of the best looking whitetails each year, but the youthful and energetic hunting team will certainly impress viewers with their fun attitude and magazine cover good looks. This attractive young couple have devoted themselves to the outdoor lifestyle and is extremely skilled in the art of hunting.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“We want to take the viewers along with us, to experience the highs and lows and the laughs and the tears that we all know are part of hunting,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ reports Lee who helped Tiffany get started into bowhunting several years ago.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A lot of people ask me Ã¢â‚¬ËœCan Tiffany really get the job done?Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ And the answer is a resounding yes! IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve seen her consistently make high pressure shots on massive trophy whitetails, time after time. I really think that the public will enjoy sharing some of these unforgettable moments with us.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nBoth Lee and Tiffany spend countless hours sharpening their hunting skills and actively manage their land for trophy whitetails in eastern Iowa.
