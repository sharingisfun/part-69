After the team breaks up, Kafka is lost, looking for a new direction in life. The comic follows Kafka as he tries different ways of becoming human: drugs, sex and fame among them. The series also visits Kafka's former teammates who each have adapted to their life post-$tranger$ in their own way.\nEnjoy and seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93c0e004802f06142c1fc8174de6970055590c5b","amp;dn":"Automatic+Kafka+1-9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93c0e004802f06142c1fc8174de6970055590c5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,192,224,4,128,47,6,20,44,31,200,23,77,230,151,0,85,89,12,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
