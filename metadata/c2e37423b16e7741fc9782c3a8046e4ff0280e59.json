The only people who can stop him are computer whiz Sam Collins and his rock 'n' roll band.  Together they enter the digital world, transform into the Superhuman Samurai Syber-Squad and battle the electronic villains!\n\nIn &quot;Do Not Reboot Till Christmas&quot;, even Malcolm and Kilokhan are in a giving mood!  They've wrapped an exploding mega-virus monster in a mega-pile of gifts and planned a light show to illuminate Servo's data base and destroy him!\n\nAnd now &quot;Kilokhan is Coming to Town&quot; to take on Servo!  Only one will survive.  Does Servo stand a ghost of a chance?\n\n\nSorry for the shitty quality, I ripped this from the best VHS that I could find.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2e37423b16e7741fc9782c3a8046e4ff0280e59","amp;dn":"Superhuman+Samurai+-+The+Glitch+that+Stole+Christmas.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2e37423b16e7741fc9782c3a8046e4ff0280e59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,227,116,35,177,110,119,65,252,151,130,195,168,4,110,79,240,40,14,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
