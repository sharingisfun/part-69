I just package it nicely for you to use.  The POIs include:\n\n1. two sources of all redlight cameras in the USA\n2. two sources of all speed cameras in the USA\n3. one source of all locations that police often use for setting up speed traps\n\nYou will hear appropriate warnings when 1000 feet from a speed camera, and 500 feet from a redlight camera.\n\nThe above is current as of November 2,  2011.\n\nOther POIs included in the SDHC folder are:\n1.
