They are considered to be among the pioneers of heavy metal and modern hard rock, although some band members claimed that their music cannot be categorised as belonging to any one genre. They were once listed by the Guinness Book of World Records as &quot;the globe's loudest band&quot;, and have sold over 100 million albums worldwide, including 7.5 million certified units in the US. Deep Purple were ranked number 22 on VH1's Greatest Artists of Hard Rock programme.\n\nThe band has gone through many line-up changes and an eight-year hiatus (1976Ã¢â‚¬â€œ84). The 1968Ã¢â‚¬â€œ76 line-ups are commonly labelled Mark I, II, III and IV. Their second and most commercially successful line-up was led by Ian Gillan (vocals), and Ritchie Blackmore (guitar). This line-up was active from 1969 to 1973, and was revived from 1984 to 1989, and again from 1992 to 1993. The band achieved more modest success in the intervening periods between 1968 and 1969 with the line-up including Rod Evans (vocals), between 1973 and 1976 with the line-up including David Coverdale (vocals), and between 1989 and 1992 with the line-up including Joe Lynn Turner (vocals). The current line-up (featuring Ian Gillan and guitarist Steve Morse from 1994) follows much longer, although organist Jon Lord's retirement from the band in 2002 has left Ian Paice (drums) as the only original Deep Purple member still in the band.\n\nAt the 2011 Classic Rock Awards in London, they received the Innovator Award. As of October 2012, Deep Purple are nominated for a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction in 2013.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPurpendicular is the fifteenth studio album by English rock band, Deep Purple. Released in 1996, it is their first album with Steve Morse, guitarist from Dixie Dregs.\n\nIt was recorded at Greg Rike Productions, Orlando, Florida, February to October 1995 and engineered by Darren Schneider and Keith Andrews. It has a more experimental feel than previous albums. &quot;The Aviator&quot; has an arrangement unlike anything else the band has previously attempted. Several of the songs, such as Vavoom: Ted the Mechanic feature smaller keyboard parts, and mainly centre around the guitar parts. Another new addition to the guitar playing was the use of pinch harmonics, very notably used on &quot;Vavoom: Ted the Mechanic&quot; and &quot;Somebody Stole My Guitar&quot;. &quot;Sometimes I Feel Like Screaming&quot; and &quot;Vavoom: Ted the Mechanic&quot; remained regular features in Deep Purple's live setlist in recent tours.\n\nLike the title of the band's following album, Abandon, Purpendicular is a pun; in this case, based on the band's name and the word &quot;Perpendicular&quot;.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ee5f2a0ad33b6c29de84fc90742e42e1ce2494b","amp;dn":"Deep+Purple+-+Purpendicular+%5B1996%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ee5f2a0ad33b6c29de84fc90742e42e1ce2494b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,229,242,160,173,51,182,194,157,232,79,201,7,66,228,46,28,226,73,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
