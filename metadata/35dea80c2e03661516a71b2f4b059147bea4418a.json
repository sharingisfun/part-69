And unlike St. Elsewhere, Chicago Hope, ER, The Doctors, Dr. Kildare, General Hospital, Ben Casey, Scrubs, Marcus Welby, MD, Doogie Howser, MD, M*A*S*H, House, LA Doctors, Nip/Tuck, Trapper John, MD, Quincy, M.E., Strong Medicine, After MASH and Doc, this one is on Thursdays at 9:00PM on ABC.\n\nNavigating the complex emotional core of Grey's Anatomy would be impossible without the help of Bridget Nelson, a writer, performer and MST3K alum, who joins Mike for back to back episodes. Dr.'s orders Ã¢â‚¬â€œ take two shows for maximum results!*\n\n*RiffTrax assumes no responsibility for pain and emotional distress caused by that last line.\n\n*******************************************************************************\nAs always donate or purchase the MP3's from Rifftrax to keep these coming...\nThis is the commentary for the first two episodes of Grey's Anatomy.
