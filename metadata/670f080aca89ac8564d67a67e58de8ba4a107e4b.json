I somehow managed to acquire this Polish TV-movie on tape, now I feel like posting it.\n\nThe story concerns a woman who has to enter hospital, and the desparate cases she encounters among the other patients. It is full of &quot;slavic soul&quot;, the colours are dak greens and browns, and the conversations are intense and philosophical.\n\nAn intimate look into a different culture.\n\nIn segmented mpg format - plays on VLC.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:670f080aca89ac8564d67a67e58de8ba4a107e4b","amp;dn":"Przez+Dotyk+%281986%29+By+Touch+M+Lazarkiewicz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"670f080aca89ac8564d67a67e58de8ba4a107e4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,15,8,10,202,137,172,133,100,214,122,103,229,141,232,186,74,16,126,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
