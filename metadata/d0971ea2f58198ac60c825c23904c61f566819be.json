'Summer Calling'. 'Beautiful Things'. Two tracks, two successive years, two conclusive anthems and ones that masterminded the rocking of countless club floors. That was followed by a recorded-but-never-released long-player, band hiatus, a parting of ways and finally, in 2011, the reunion. All of which has led to this point: the release of Andain's first official album.\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. Turn Up The Sound 5:46\n2. Like 5:54\n3. Much Too Much 5:00\n4. Ave Maria 4:30\n5.
