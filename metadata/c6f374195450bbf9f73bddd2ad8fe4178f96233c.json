The Moon appears larger when it's closer, and smaller when it's more distant.\n\nYou can smoothly drag the Moon phase back and forth with your finger, or even &quot;spin it&quot; to quickly advance forwards or backwards. It's kind of hypnotic.\n\nÃ¢ËœÂ½ Beautiful images of the Moon were made by NASA from data collected by spacecraft.\n\nÃ¢ËœÂ½ See the current date, distance, phase name and illumination percentage.\n\nÃ¢ËœÂ½ Swipe left and right to move forward or backwards in time to see what the Moon will look like in the future or past. It slides back and forth with &quot;buttery&quot; smoothness. Spin it faster or slower.\n\nÃ¢ËœÂ½ Need to find the next full Moon? You can click a button to take you to the next full Moon or new Moon.\n\nÃ¢ËœÂ½ You can also access a calendar that shows you the phase of the Moon for any date in the future.\n\nÃ¢ËœÂ½ Share your phase of the Moon images on all the popular social networks\n\nÃ¢ËœÂ½ Put a phase of the Moon widget right on your desktop\n\nDeveloped by Universe Today.
