The series centers on Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall), a blood spatter pattern analyst for the fictional Miami Metro Police Department (based on the real life Miami-Dade Police Department) who moonlights as a serial killer. Set in Miami, the show's first season was largely based on the novel Darkly Dreaming Dexter by Jeff Lindsay, the first of his Dexter series novels. Subsequent seasons have evolved independently of Lindsay's works. It was adapted for television by screenwriter James Manos, Jr., who wrote the first episode.\n\nSeason 7 will premiere on September 30, 2012. Executive producer Sara Colleton confirmed that Season 8 will be the show's last season, and that they already know how the show is going to end.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5685c8eb815395ffead36c54d56abc7b261445dd","amp;dn":"Dexter.S07E02.720p.HDTV.MPEG2-SM10+%28Optimised+for+PS3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5685c8eb815395ffead36c54d56abc7b261445dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,133,200,235,129,83,149,255,234,211,108,84,213,106,188,123,38,20,69,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
