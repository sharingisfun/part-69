Sure everyone fills the seats like obedient sheep on Sunday when they think God wants them to be there.  Or when the neighbors are watching.  But how truly devoted to God are those same very people during mid-week services when perhaps they need God the most?\n\nLikewise, here on The Pirate Bay, I learned a long time ago the strength of my bundled torrents based upon how many people stuck around and continued to share them for others long after they've downloaded the bundle for themselves.  Compared to my discographies, even my 2011 bundles are still healthy today.\n\nThat's why I was a little surprised, back in my 38th bundle, when nobody responded to my question of whether or not I should continue bundling after I reached my goal of 1000.  Sure I knew people were downloading the stuff, but at this point was I just filling hard drives, or feeding souls?\n\nBecause of that, it was my intention to quit the bundles until 2013.  And then reevaluate.  But with the favorable support I've recently read in the comments section of my last 41st bundle, how could I stop now?  So for anyone who still has some hard drive space left available, here are 23 additional albums today, for a running total of 1090 releases on the year.  And counting!  :)\n\nThe 23 titles in this 42nd bundle today include...\n\n * 116 Clique - 2012 - Come Alive - Single\n * August Burns Red - 2012 - Sleddin Hill - A Holiday Album\n * Bread Of Stone - 2012 - The Real Life\n * Bryan Duncan - 2012 - Conversations\n * Citipointe Live - 2012 - Higher Wider Deeper - Raw Moments\n * December Days - 2012 - Others About Me EP\n * December Days - 2012 - Revival\n * Faith Evans - 2012 - R&amp;B Divas\n * Heather Headley - 2012 - Only One In The World\n * Hillsong - 2012 - Global Project\n * Je'kob - 2012 - Faith\n * Jordan Armstrong - 2012 - Stronger\n * Marlene Brehm - 2012 - Reach The Sky\n * Matthew West - 2012 - Into The Light\n * Mike Blanton And Evidence - 2012 - I'm Gonna Keep On\n * Propaganda - 2012 - Excellent\n * Showbread - 2012 - Cancer\n * Steve Green - 2012 - Christmas EP\n * T-Haddy - 2012 - Hood Gospel, Vol 2\n * Third Generation - 2012 - Goin' Back\n * Various - 2012 - Electropraise, Vol 2\n * Wedding, The - 2012 - No Direction\n * WoW Hits - 2012 - WoW Hits 2013 - Deluxe Edition\n\nGod Bless,\nTorrentTracts - September 2012\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f5e3236a9d542bc3667a491b3540d169486834b","amp;dn":"2012+-+The+Year+In+Christian+Music+%28Bundle+42+of+42%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f5e3236a9d542bc3667a491b3540d169486834b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,94,50,54,169,213,66,188,54,103,164,145,179,84,13,22,148,134,131,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
