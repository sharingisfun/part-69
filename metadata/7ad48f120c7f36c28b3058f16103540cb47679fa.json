It analyses their contents and is claimed to be able to refresh the magnetic disk surfaces to allow them to operate more reliably.\nSpinRite attempts to recover data from hard disks with damaged portions that may not be readable via the operating system. When the program encounters a sector with errors that cannot be corrected by the disk drive's error-correcting code, it tries to read the sector up to 2000 times, in order to determine, by comparing the successive results, the most probable value of each bit. The data is then saved onto a new block on the same disk; it cannot be saved elsewhere. In this respect SpinRite differs from most data recovery software, which usually provides (and recommends) an option to save the recovered data onto another disk, or onto a separate partition on the same disk.[2]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ad48f120c7f36c28b3058f16103540cb47679fa","amp;dn":"SpinRite+V6.3431119+Retail.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ad48f120c7f36c28b3058f16103540cb47679fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,212,143,18,12,127,54,194,139,48,88,241,97,3,84,12,180,118,121,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
