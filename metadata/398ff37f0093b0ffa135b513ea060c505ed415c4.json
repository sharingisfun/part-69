She in fact is the Lady of Shallot and this is her full story. The Passing of Arthur is the great climax of the sequence.\n\nNote that the first Tennyson upload, a Penguin Audiobook collection of Tennyson's verse, was unable to be uploaded to this site because of a filename error since it contained text files. Go to the 'Current Poetry Torrents' Folder and download it as it is has exemplary verse readings of Tennyson, (Lotos-eaters, Oenone, The Lady of Shallot, The Kraken Wakes etc.) with a literate and interesting commentary on Tennyson from his humble beginnings to the exalted Victorian conclusion.
