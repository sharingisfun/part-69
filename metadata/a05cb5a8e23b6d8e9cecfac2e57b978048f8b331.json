I found them once again thanks to ebay and figured someone else may be looking for them too. You can always upload to Artscow or some other site which will print them on the wax cards for you. \n\nThis is all 52 suited cards with a scan of the back and one joker (since they were the same).\n\nenjoy!\n\nsbogo","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a05cb5a8e23b6d8e9cecfac2e57b978048f8b331","amp;dn":"Deck+of+Cards","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a05cb5a8e23b6d8e9cecfac2e57b978048f8b331","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,92,181,168,226,59,109,142,156,236,250,194,229,123,151,128,72,248,179,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
