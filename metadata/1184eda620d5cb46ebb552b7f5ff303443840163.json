It's 1945, she's married to JÃƒÂ©rÃƒÂ´me, a somewhat fussy milquetoast, diffident to the war around him and unwilling to move his wife to Paris, where she longs to live, shop, and party. A German outfit is bivouacked at JÃƒÂ©rÃƒÂ´me and Marie's crumbling chÃƒÂ¢teau because its commanding officer is pursuing Marie. She's also eyed by a French spy working with the Allies as they plan D-Day. He woos her (posing to the Germans as her brother) and, in his passion, forgets his mission. Heroics come from an unexpected direction, and Marie makes her choice.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1184eda620d5cb46ebb552b7f5ff303443840163","amp;dn":"La+Vie+de+chateau+1966+DVD5.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1184eda620d5cb46ebb552b7f5ff303443840163","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,132,237,166,32,213,203,70,235,181,82,183,245,255,48,52,67,132,1,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
