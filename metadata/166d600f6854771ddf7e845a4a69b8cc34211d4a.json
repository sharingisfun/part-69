The roads from Samba through Bossa Nova to Hip Hop are a complex web of musical whispers and echoes. Brasilintime is a 2-hour documentary that traverses this journey. In November of 2002, drummers and DJs traveled to Sao Paulo Brazil to expand the multi-generational conversation to include their counterparts from the world of Samba, Bossa Nova and Samba Rock, as well as the best new talent from Brazilian Hip Hop. This show was recorded and became the basis for this DVD. Brasilintime speaks the language of the music it addresses. \n\nCredits\nArt Direction - Keith Tamashiro\nDesign [Graphic Design] - Kristian Henson , Stephen Serrato\nDrums - Ivan &quot;MamÃƒÂ£o&quot; Conti* , James Gadson , Paul Humphrey , Wilson Das Neves\nEdited By, Photography [Additional] - Luke Lynch\nEngineer - Richard Burton\nEngineer [Additional] - Kelly Hibbert\nExecutive Producer, Mixed By - Brian Cross \nExecutive Producer, Photography [Director] - Eric Coleman\nFilm Director, Photography [Additional] - B+*\nMixed By - Dave Cooley\nOther [Narrator] - Debora Pill\nOther [Post-producer] - Andrew Barchilon\nOther [Show Producer], Other [Stage Manager] - Pena Schmidt\nOther [Special Appearances] - NelsÃƒÂ£o Triunfo , Will.I.Am\nPercussion - Derf Reklaw , JoÃƒÂ£o Parahyba\nPhotography [Additional] - Chico , Hiro Matsuyama , Horatio Martins , Nicola , Paul Factora , Pilar Wiley , Rodrigo Menke , Vaughan Glover\nPhotography [Director] - Jerry Henry\nProducer - Andrea Chia , Daniel Lieff\nProducer [Associate] - John Liu , Red Bull Brasil , Red Bull Music Academy , Richard Cross\nTurntables - Babu , Cut Chemist , Nuts*\nTurntables [Boss 303] - Madlib\nTurntables, Photography [Additional] - J.Rocc*\n\nAlso includes:\nBrasilintime - Live In KÃƒÂ¶ln 21:18\nwith Jaki Liebezeit, Can's Drummer","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:166d600f6854771ddf7e845a4a69b8cc34211d4a","amp;dn":"Brasilintime%3A+Batucada+com+Discos+%282006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"166d600f6854771ddf7e845a4a69b8cc34211d4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,109,96,15,104,84,119,29,223,126,132,90,74,105,184,204,52,33,29,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
