Ichigo vs. Ichigo&quot;\n\nIn order for Ichigo to transform into a Soul Reaper when Rukia is not around, she purchases some soul candy from the Urahara Shop for him. However, the candy is actually a modified soul, an artificial warrior from Soul Society created to destroy hollows. Once inside Ichigo's body the modified soul goes on a rampage, ruining Ichigo's social image. \n\n7 \t&quot;Greetings from a Stuffed Lion&quot;\n\nIchigo confronts the modified soul possessing his body, but is then distracted by an emerging hollow. Together, they defeat the hollow. When Kisuke Urahara, the merchant who sold Rukia her gigai, comes for the &quot;defective&quot; merchandise, Ichigo takes the modified soul back. He places the modified soul into a stuffed lion plushie and names it &quot;Kon&quot;. Meanwhile in the Soul Society, another Soul Reaper is sent to track down Rukia, who has spent too much time in the living world and needs retrieving. \n\n8 \t&quot;June 17, Memories in the Rain&quot;\n\nIchigo and his family visit their mother's grave on the anniversary of her death. While there, the Soul Reaper sent for Rukia attacks them because she broke the Soul Society law by giving Ichigo her powers. The battle halts when Ichigo's sisters Karin and Yuzu are attacked by a huge hollow. \n\n9 \t&quot;Unbeatable Enemy&quot;\n\nIchigo confronts the hollow, who is revealed as the Grand Fisher, the hollow who killed Ichigo's mother. In a fit of rage, Ichigo defeats the hollow, but does not manage to kill it. The Soul Reaper sent after Rukia leaves with a warning when he witnesses Ichigo's strength. \n\n10 \t&quot;Assault on Trip at Sacred Ground!&quot;\n\nWhen popular TV star/spirit medium Don Kanonji transforms a spirit into a hollow during an exorcism, Ichigo is forced to clean up the mess. Upon the hollow's defeat, Don Kanonji is shocked to realize what he has done. With a little cheer-up from Ichigo, Don Kanonji is back to his old self again, and calls Ichigo, despite Ichigo's objections, his new apprentice.\n\nUploader Notes:\n===============\n\nUse VLC Player for best results.\n\nSeed and enjoy... :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:199e1a7f180d0778d9e87fa55ee458edd98de2f6","amp;dn":"Bleach+Ep.+6-10+%28Eng.+Sub%29+%5BSpeedy+Joe%5D+%28480p%29+%5BPirateBoyTPB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"199e1a7f180d0778d9e87fa55ee458edd98de2f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,158,26,127,24,13,7,120,217,232,127,165,94,228,88,237,217,141,226,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
