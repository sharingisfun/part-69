Baaro will continue to work on selected episodes with periodic new releases, although for some episodes a translator who does not need to rely on captions would be quite helpful.  (Contact Licca in #fusion-rips on irc.hoshinet.org.)\n\nAdditional text:\n\nThis is R2J with occasional grafts from R1 (mainly in episodes 7, 8 and 10), with edited R1 subtitles.  To save work, the English dub is NOT included, only Japanese audio with English subtitles.  These MKVs are 100% softsub.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8ddae26765e538b8914498d41842a093e7ce77b","amp;dn":"%5BCF%26amp%3BB%5D+Detective+Conan+001-123+%28BATCH%29+%5BENG-SUB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8ddae26765e538b8914498d41842a093e7ce77b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,221,174,38,118,94,83,139,137,20,73,141,65,132,42,9,62,124,231,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
