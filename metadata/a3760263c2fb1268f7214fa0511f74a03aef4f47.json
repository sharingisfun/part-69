Miller Tobin.\nCast: David Strathairn, Ryan Cartwright, Warren Christie, Azita Ghanizada, Laura Mennell, Malik Yoba, Mahershala Ali, John Pyper-Ferguson, Erin Way, Kathleen Munroe.\n\nAlphas is an American science fiction dramatic television series created by Zak Penn and Michael Karnow. The series follows a group of people with superhuman abilities, known as &quot;Alphas&quot;, as they work to prevent crimes committed by other Alphas.\nThe series is broadcast in the United States on the cable channel Syfy and is a co-production between BermanBraun and Universal Cable Productions. It premiered on July 11, 2011. After initial reports that the show was cancelled,[2] on September 7, 2011, Alphas was renewed for a 13-episode second season, which premiered on Monday, July 23, 2012, at 10 pm ET.\n\nThanks to EVOLVE for the original source file, however MKV's do not work natively on PS3 so this has been given the SM10 touch. Converted to MPEG2 and re-synced to accommodate that change and configured a few filters to maximise colour on those bigger screens.\nThis is a regular upload of mine. Previous episodes appeared on D-Noid before the outage so I am continuing here, for now.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3760263c2fb1268f7214fa0511f74a03aef4f47","amp;dn":"Alphas.S02E11.720p.HDTV.MPEG2-SM10+%28Optimised+for+PS3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3760263c2fb1268f7214fa0511f74a03aef4f47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,118,2,99,194,251,18,104,247,33,79,160,81,31,116,160,58,239,79,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
