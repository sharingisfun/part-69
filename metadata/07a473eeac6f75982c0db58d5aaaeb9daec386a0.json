This creates a twist on the classic whodunit suspense format that may be described as &quot;Who's going to do it to whom?&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€ as all of the quirky passengers seem like potential culprits and/or victims. At first the note is brushed off as a prank, but the plot thickens considerably once passengers do begin turning up murdered.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_on_Flight_502&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_on_Flight_502&lt;/a&gt;\nwww.imdb.com/title/tt0073418/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07a473eeac6f75982c0db58d5aaaeb9daec386a0","amp;dn":"Murder+on+Flight+502","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07a473eeac6f75982c0db58d5aaaeb9daec386a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,164,115,238,172,111,117,152,44,13,181,141,90,170,235,157,174,195,134,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
