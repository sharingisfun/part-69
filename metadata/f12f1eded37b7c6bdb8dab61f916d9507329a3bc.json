The program handles the most common sensor chips, like ITEÃ‚Â® IT87 series, most WinbondÃ‚Â® ICs, and others. In addition, it can read modern CPUs on-die core thermal sensors, as well has hard drives temperature via S.M.A.R.T, and video card GPU temperature.\n\n\nFeatures:\n\nRemote Monitoring\nWatch the sensors of one or several distant PCs through a simple TCP/IP connection.\n\nGraph Generator\nSave monitoring data and generate logging graphs as bitmap files.\n\nImproved Interface\nSensors in system tray, editable sensors labels ...\n\nPWM Control\nFan PWM control (for ESA compliant devices).\n\n\nChanges\nFixed package temperature on AMD FX (Zambezi and Vishera).\nReport real-time power on AMD FX (Zambezi and Vishera).\nSupport complete telemetry on AMD APU (Trinity).\nFixed package power on multi-CPU Intel platforms.\nAdded support of Nuvoton NCT7904D chip.\nAdded option &quot;Minimize to tray&quot;.\nSupport for Antec CC watercoolers. That support is preliminary, it requires the use of the 32-bit version of HWMonitorPRO, and requires that the ChilControl application does NOT run in the same time.\n\nInstall:\n\n- run application\n- use keygen","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f12f1eded37b7c6bdb8dab61f916d9507329a3bc","amp;dn":"CPUID+HWMonitor+Pro+v1.15","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f12f1eded37b7c6bdb8dab61f916d9507329a3bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,47,30,222,211,123,124,107,219,141,171,97,249,22,217,80,115,41,163,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
