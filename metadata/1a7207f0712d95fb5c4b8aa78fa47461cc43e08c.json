Moving from &quot;the myth&quot; through &quot;the analysis&quot; and into &quot;the players&quot;, careful deconstruction of the official story set right alongside clean, clear science. The 9/11 picture is not one of politics or nationalism or loyalty, but one of strict and simple physics. How do you get a 10-second 110-story pancake collapse?\n\nSubtitles are in slovak language.\n\n\nReviews\n\n&quot;Excellent. The best of the 9/11--David Ray Griffin, author of The New Pearl Harbor\n\n&quot;WOW! is my reaction to this movie. Great insight into demolitions and what really happened on 9/11/2001.&quot; --Steven E. Jones, physics professor, Brigham Young University\n\n&quot;An outstanding contribution to understanding 9/11. Simply superb.&quot; --James H.
