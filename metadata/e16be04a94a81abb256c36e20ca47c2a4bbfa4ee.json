Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware can detect and remove malware that even the most well-known Anti-Virus and Anti-Malware applications on the market today cannot.\n\nMalwarebytes' Anti-Malware monitors every process and stops malicious processes before they even start. The Realtime Protection Module uses our advanced heuristic scanning technology which monitors your system to keep it safe and secure. In addition, we have implemented a threats center which will allow you to keep up to date with the latest malware threats\n\nInstall Notes\n\n1. Unpack &amp; Install.\n2. Use our keymaker (w00t.exe) to generate id&amp;serial.\n\nRelease Notes\n\nThe program does not validate serial if a keygen is detected. To avoid that, always CLOSE KEYGEN BEFORE VALIDATING THE SERIAL !!! I Won't responsible if serial is refused because you did'nt close the keygen. MBAM now detects some keygens as &quot;don't.steal.our.software&quot; :p ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e16be04a94a81abb256c36e20ca47c2a4bbfa4ee","amp;dn":"Malwarebytes+Anti-Malware+1.65.1.1000+-+FFF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e16be04a94a81abb256c36e20ca47c2a4bbfa4ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,107,224,74,148,168,26,187,37,108,54,226,12,164,124,42,75,191,164,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
