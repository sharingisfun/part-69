Their drummer Randy Smith dropped out of the band due to tendonitis and their bassist, James Taylor, was killed in a car accident. Eventually deciding to continue on, the group debuts a new bassist on After the Storm in addition to welcoming guest pianist/organist Kenny &quot;Blues Boss&quot; Wayne. The heartfelt vocals of Brandon Isaak and Dave &quot;Hurricane&quot; Hoerl along with their solos on guitar and harmonica give the Twisters their own musical personality. Their material is consistently bluesy while not always being confined to the 12-bar blues. The group is particularly effective on blues ballads and none of these dozen songs (the only non-original, &quot;Bye Bye Bird,&quot; is a brief tribute to James Taylor) are throwaways.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63ea50c54dfc6f09fc846d77e6fda1ab21b0637b","amp;dn":"The+Twisters+-+After+The+Storm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63ea50c54dfc6f09fc846d77e6fda1ab21b0637b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,234,80,197,77,252,111,9,252,132,109,119,230,253,161,171,33,176,99,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
