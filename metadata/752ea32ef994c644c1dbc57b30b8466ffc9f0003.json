In this film, Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) is only eight days away from retirement and his partner, Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson), once again manages to get them both into hot water with both the LAPD and the bad guys, who this time are Jack Travis (Stuart Wilson) and a gang of hoodlums selling armor-piercing bullets. Joe Pesci returns as the fast-talking schmuck Leo Getz. A new addition to the cast is Rene Russo as Lorna Cole, a sergeant from internal affairs sent to investigate Riggs and Murtaugh, but who ultimately ends up falling in love with the caffeinated Riggs. \n\nRipped with Handbrake\n\nLength: 1 Hour 58 Minutes\n\nFile Type: MP4\n\nFrame Width: 624\n\nFrame Height: 352\n\nFrame Rate: 29fps\n\nAudio\n\nBit Rate: 159kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:752ea32ef994c644c1dbc57b30b8466ffc9f0003","amp;dn":"Lethal+Weapon+3%281992%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK%28Fixed%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"752ea32ef994c644c1dbc57b30b8466ffc9f0003","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,46,163,46,249,148,198,68,193,219,197,123,48,184,70,111,252,159,0,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
