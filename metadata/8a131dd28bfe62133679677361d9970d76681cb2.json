But of course I have even DVD (Full) version.\n\nThis film about struggle between students and professors is based on the book by Czech teacher and writer Jaroslav ZÃƒÂ¡k and its faithful to that pattern. The movie is a compilation of the stories from the students' life in some small town somewhere in the Czechoslovak republic in 30's of the 20th century.\n\nBut there are some &quot;main plots&quot; - first could be the story about the new young professor of Latin who comes to the school and finds there his own former professor of biology, who still teaches. The young professor tries with the help of the students get the old popular professor to the tests for becoming the &quot;real&quot; professor (which means higher salary).\n\nEverybody who was a student in the high/grammar school minimally once in a lifetime - has to see it! Funny, clever, astonishing.\n\nAbsolute classic. 10/10","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a131dd28bfe62133679677361d9970d76681cb2","amp;dn":"Cesta+do+hlubin+studakovy+duse","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a131dd28bfe62133679677361d9970d76681cb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,19,29,210,139,254,98,19,54,121,103,115,97,217,151,13,118,104,28,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
