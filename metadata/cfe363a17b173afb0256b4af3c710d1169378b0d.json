(win 7) in fact its probably worse then XP for the problem","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfe363a17b173afb0256b4af3c710d1169378b0d","amp;dn":"WinLongRenamerTool+v1%2C0a+-+Rename+Long+Filenames+that+explorer+f","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfe363a17b173afb0256b4af3c710d1169378b0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,227,99,161,123,23,58,251,2,86,180,175,60,113,13,17,105,55,139,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
