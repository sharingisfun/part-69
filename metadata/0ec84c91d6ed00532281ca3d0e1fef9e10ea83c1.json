Rich strings, wall to wall brass, and fat punchy basses. And we haven't forgotten techno sounds either. SimSynth Live uses a filter technique that gives the EMPH knob a sound you can crank.\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Specifications:\n\n\n3 oscillators, each with a dual (warm) mode effectively making 6 oscillators\n\nRing modulator\n\nA dual SVF filter that programs like an old Oberheim SEM, (lets you mix lowpass, bandpass, and highpass)\n\nTwo discrete envelopes and an LFO.Stereo chorus effect, (in case 6 oscillators aren't warm enough)\n\nStudio quality alias free rendering\n\nFX Panel with EQ, Reverb, Phaser &amp; Delay\n\nFL Studio &amp; VSTi versions included\n\n\n\n\nSystem requirements\n\n\n2Ghz AMD or Intel Pentium 3 compatible CPU with full SSE1 support\n\n512Mb RAM.\n\n30Mb free disc space.\n\nDirectSound or ASIO compatible soundcard. \n\n\n\n\nINSTALLATION:\n\n\n   Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  Next open the .rar file by double clicking it. If you can't open it you need to get an archiver which supports rar files such as Winrar and extract.\n\n   Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Install the setup...\n\n   Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Import registry, double-click on it\n\n\n\n\n        Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  That's it! Done.\n\n\n\n                       3Nj0Y!!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ec84c91d6ed00532281ca3d0e1fef9e10ea83c1","amp;dn":"Image-Line+SimSynth+Live+v1.1.15+-+R2R+%5Bds%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ec84c91d6ed00532281ca3d0e1fef9e10ea83c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,200,76,145,214,237,0,83,34,129,202,61,14,31,239,158,16,234,131,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
