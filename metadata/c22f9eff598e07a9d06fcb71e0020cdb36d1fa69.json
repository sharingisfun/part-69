With Leeb responsible for finding samples, writing lyrics, creating basslines, sequencing, and overseeing the project and Fulber handling the sampling and programming and using a chords/string pad to craft additional melodies and arrangements, the group's sound is a dance-inspiring mix of electronics and post-industrial attitude. Although he initially attracted attention as a member of several cyberpunk/industrial bands, Fulber took a more ambient dance approach with Delerium. The group found success with its 1997 album Karma, which sold more than a quarter of a million copies and included a major club/dance hit, &quot;Silence,&quot; that reached number three in the United Kingdom, number one in Ireland, number four in Belgium, and number five in Australia. With the members of Delerium separating in the mid-'90s, Fulber produced albums by P.O.D., Sarah Brightman, David Foster, and Fear Factory. The band reunited in 2001 and released Poem, followed by Chimera two years later. In 2004 Nettwerk released the 1994-2004 collection Best Of. Their 2006 effort Nuages du Monde featured singers from around the world, including opera star Isabel Baryakdarian and Punjabi singer Kiran Arwuhalia. Music Box Opera from 2012 arrived with a different set of vocalists, including Leona Naess, Kristy Thirsk, and Michael Logen. Fulber and Leeb have also recorded as Intermix and Noise Unit. \n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFLAC Lossless\nLabel:\t\t\tNettwerk\nCatalog:\t\tCD 30969 2\nAudiochecker:\t\t99.86% CDDA \nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Consciousness Of Love (Feat.
