Metoure Traore's guitar-and-horn heavy Horoya Band was formed in 1964, and eventually dissolved in the early '80s, as public tastes changed in the face of more modernized international pop. This is lush, lovely stuff taken off old albums and 45rpm singles that came out mostly in the early '70s -- the guitar work that underpins these tracks is uniformly gorgeous, though at times the brass arrangements can be a bit shrill and off-in-another-worldish. Cool stuff, though, with odd hints of Afro-Beat, surf, and Arabic influences. If you enjoyed the excellent &quot;GUINEA&quot; '70s compilations, then this disc is a nice chance to check out one of the better-known Guinean bands at greater length.  ~DJ Joe Sixpack \n\n01.
