W. Brands - The Murder of Jim Fisk for the Love of Josie Mansfield: A Tragedy of the Gilded Age\n\nUnabridged, 96 kbps, read by Richard McGonagle\n\nEven before he was shot dead on the stairway of the tony Grand Central Hotel in 1872, financier James Ã¢â‚¬Å“Jubilee JimÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Fisk, Jr., was a notorious New York City figure. From his audacious attempt to corner the gold market in 1869 to his battle for control of the geographically crucial Erie Railroad, Fisk was a flamboyant exemplar of a new financial era marked by volatile fortunes and unprecedented greed and corruption. But it was his scandalously open affair with a showgirl named Josie Mansfield that ultimately led to his demise.\n\nIn this riveting short historyÃ¢â‚¬â€the first in his American Portraits seriesÃ¢â‚¬â€H. W. Brands traces FiskÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s extraordinary downfall, bringing to life New YorkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Gilded Age and some of its legendary players, including Boss William Tweed, Cornelius Vanderbilt, and the railroad tycoon Jay Gould.\n\nKirkus Reviews\nOverlooked Gilded Age crooked financier Jim Fisk receives a compelling historical exhumation.\n\nIntending to highlight &quot;forgotten chapters of American history,&quot; the inaugural volume in the American Portraits Series reanimates the heady histrionics of eccentric stock broker and corporate executive Jim Fisk during his zenith in the mid 19th century. The narrative begins with Fisk's funeral procession through the streets of Manhattan, lined with mourners both personal and professional. As his girlfriend many years prior, buxom showgirl Josie Mansfield grew weary of the &quot;spectacle&quot; and business cunning that garnered Fisk many lucrative associations, including partnering in 1868 with slick entrepreneur Dan Drew and tycoon Jay Gould, who, altogether, managed to seize control of the Erie Railroad from formidable Wall Street kingpin Cornelius Vanderbilt. Together with duplicitous politician William Tweed, Fisk was already embroiled in lawsuits and Mansfield had fallen for handsome associate Edward Stokes. Wanting his money but not him, she and Stokes attempted blackmail with personal letters incriminating him in illegal mischief. Brands (History/Univ. of Texas; American Dreams: The United States Since 1945, 2010, etc.) takes particular joy in unfolding the high-profile courtroom melodrama in the second half of the book with seemingly verbatim exchange of emotional testimony cresting with the imbroglio of Fisk's violent murder at Stokes' hand. The author makes liberal use of photographs, journalistic accounts, summaries of court proceedings and trial transcripts, all offering &quot;blow-by-blow and word-for-word coverage&quot; of the key players. With swift prose and exacting detail, Brands transports readers back in time to an ostentatious era rooted in swift industrialization, avarice and corruption, in which men like Fisk thrivedÃ¢â‚¬â€and ultimately perished.\n\nA wonderfully creative beginning to what promises to be a revitalizing history series.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2a03ca854a33598f3aa3cc891a2ae54a3d68b95","amp;dn":"H.W.+Brands+-+Murder+of+Jim+Fisk+%5B96%5D+Unabridged","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2a03ca854a33598f3aa3cc891a2ae54a3d68b95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,160,60,168,84,163,53,152,243,170,60,200,145,162,174,84,163,214,139,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
