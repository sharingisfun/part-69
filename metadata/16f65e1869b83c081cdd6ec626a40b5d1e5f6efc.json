Jackie wants her fiancÃƒÂ©, Simon Doyle (Simon MacCorkindale), to work for Linnet. But he and Linnet have a whirlwind affair and end up marrying. While honeymooning in Egypt, they are continually hounded by a jilted Jackie. In an attempt to get away, the Doyles board a Nile paddle steamer, the S.S. Karnak.\n\nWhen the passengers venture off-shore to examine a nearby temple, a large stone is pushed off a pillar and narrowly misses Simon and Linnet. They again encounter Jackie, who boards the ship and ignores the warnings of detective Hercule Poirot (Peter Ustinov) to stay away, revealing that she carries a small pistol. After a late-night game of cards in the ship's lounge, Jackie confronts Simon. She shoots him in a drunken rage and hits him in the leg. The next morning, Linnet Ridgeway is discovered murdered in her cabin, shot in the head by a similar weapon, with almost everyone aboard the S.S. Karnak having had a reason to want to do away with the heiress. The pistol has meanwhile gone missing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16f65e1869b83c081cdd6ec626a40b5d1e5f6efc","amp;dn":"Death+on+the+Nile+%281978%29+%5BDVDrip%2Fx264%2FAAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16f65e1869b83c081cdd6ec626a40b5d1e5f6efc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,246,94,24,105,184,60,8,28,221,110,198,38,164,11,93,30,95,110,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
