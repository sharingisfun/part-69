Reverberate seeks to provide a richer and more dynamic sounding reverb from impulse responses by optionally modulating an amalgamation of two, separately controllable IRs using an LFO.\n\nReverberate provides a rich and dynamic reverb from impulse responses by modulating an amalgamation of two, separately controllable true stereo IRs using an LFO. Further modulation is possible using the post-processing effects; an all-pass interpolator chorus and delay unit provide a fuller sound and an over-sampled analogue prototype paragraphic equaliser is provided with dual LFOs. These features make for a livelier, more creative sound than typically associated with some convolution reverbs.\n\nIn addition to loading impulse responses from audio files Reverberate is able to generate supplementary independent early reflections and tails for additional control over a roomÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sonic characteristics.\n\nChangelog:\n\n- All: Bugfix for IR2 early reflections module.\n\nINSTALLATION:\n\n  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  Unistall any previus versions\n\n  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  Next open the .rar file by double clicking it.
