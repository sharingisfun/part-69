Their sole album originally appeared in April 1969, and features intense jamming, with plenty of swirling organ and tough guitar.  When it failed to sell, they split, with three members going on to form 1970's hitmakers &quot;A Foot In Coldwater&quot;.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7fe0784aab171b8eb7f2596247a582a9322a6f2","amp;dn":"Nucleus+-+Nucleus+%5B1969%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D%5BRMSTD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7fe0784aab171b8eb7f2596247a582a9322a6f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,254,7,132,170,177,113,184,235,127,37,150,36,122,88,42,147,34,166,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
