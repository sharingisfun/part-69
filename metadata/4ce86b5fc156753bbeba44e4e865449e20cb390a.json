Atop their list of abusers during the past few decades has been faith healer Benny Hinn.\n\nThis Dallas-based watchdog group has worked with news organizations to expose the corruption of various television ministers, including Hinn. Many of these investigative reports on Hinn Ã¢â‚¬â€ spearheaded by the Trinity Foundation Ã¢â‚¬â€ make up the bulk of this DVD set. They show Hinn at his worst, including his power-wielding control, opulent lifestyle, bogus healings, lies and deception, heretical theology, and much more. A single report should make anyone question the integrity of this man; viewing several hours of investigations should leave no doubt. The presentation also includes segments from HinnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s broadcasts that have not been shown in news reports. These include his stage antics, absurd theological statements, and false prophecies.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.\n\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\n\n\n      :thankyou:    :thankyou:     Thank You JESUS  \n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ce86b5fc156753bbeba44e4e865449e20cb390a","amp;dn":"POtHS+-+Apostasy+The+Great+Falling+Away+Vol+11+-+The+Many+Faces+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ce86b5fc156753bbeba44e4e865449e20cb390a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,232,107,95,193,86,117,59,190,186,68,228,232,101,68,158,32,203,57,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
