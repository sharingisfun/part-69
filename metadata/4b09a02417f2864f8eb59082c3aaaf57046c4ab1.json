But behind that mantra lies a vast network of corporate lobbying and political action aimed to increase corporate profits at public expense without public knowledge.\n\nUsing interviews, documents, and field reporting, the episode explores ALECÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s self-serving machine at work, acting in a way one Wisconsin politician describes as Ã¢â‚¬Å“a corporate dating service for lonely legislators and corporate special interests.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nIn state houses around the country, hundreds of pieces of boilerplate ALEC legislation are proposed or enacted that would, among other things, dilute collective bargaining rights, make it harder for some Americans to vote, and limit corporate liability for harm caused to consumers Ã¢â‚¬â€ each accomplished without the public ever knowing whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s behind it.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“All of us here are very familiar with ALEC and the influence that ALEC has with many of the [legislative] members,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ says Arizona State Senator Steve Farley. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Corporations have the right to present their arguments, but they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have the right to do it secretly.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://billmoyers.com/episode/full-show-united-states-of-alec/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://billmoyers.com/episode/full-show-united-states-of-alec/&lt;/a&gt; (flv)\n \nshunster","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b09a02417f2864f8eb59082c3aaaf57046c4ab1","amp;dn":"Moyers+%26amp%3B+Company%7EUnited+States+of+ALEC++2012+09+28","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b09a02417f2864f8eb59082c3aaaf57046c4ab1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,9,160,36,23,242,134,79,142,181,144,130,195,170,175,87,4,108,74,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
