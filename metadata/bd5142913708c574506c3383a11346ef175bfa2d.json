It tells the story of how Israel paid for their nuclear program with the blood of Sephardi Jewish children. When laws were passed in the United States and other countries banning the testing of dangerous substances on human beings, the U.S. Military turned to Israel to do their radiation testing for them in return for money and a nuclear program. \n\nTo fulfill their end of the bargain, the Israeli government removed Sephardi Jewish children from their classrooms and bussed them to medical facilities.
