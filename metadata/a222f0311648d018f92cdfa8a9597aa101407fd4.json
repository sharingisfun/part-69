However, the play is a love story where the leading female role gets to kiss Luke and &quot;Creepy&quot; Connie is trying to get all the girls away from getting the leading female role so she can end up being the leading female role so she can kiss Luke. In the end, Connie stops trying to get Luke to like her and ends up going out with Ravi instead. Meanwhile, Zuri job-shadows Bertram for her school report.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a222f0311648d018f92cdfa8a9597aa101407fd4","amp;dn":"Jessie+Season+1+episode+23+Flv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a222f0311648d018f92cdfa8a9597aa101407fd4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,34,240,49,22,72,208,24,249,44,223,168,169,89,122,161,1,64,127,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
