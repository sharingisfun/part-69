There are two sides to any quarrel . . . unless there are more.\n\nQueen Elizabeth of Manticore's first cousin and Honor Harrington's best friend, Michelle Henke, has just handed the &quot;invincible&quot; Solarian League Navy the most humiliating, one sided defeat in its entire almost thousand year history in defense of the people of the Star Empire's Talbott Quadrant. But the League is the most powerful star nation in the history of humanity. Its navy is going to be backÃ¢â‚¬â€and this time with thousands of superdreadnoughts.\n\nYet she also knows scores of other star systemsÃ¢â‚¬â€some independent, some controlled by puppet regimes, and some simply conquered outright by the Solarian Office of Frontier SecurityÃ¢â‚¬â€lie in the League's grip along its frontier with the Talbott Quadrant. As combat spreads from the initial confrontation,the entire frontier has begun to seethe with unrest, and Michelle sympathizes with the oppressed populations wanting only to be free of their hated masters.\n\nAnd that puts her in something of a quandary when a messenger from Mobius arrives, because someone's obviously gotten a wrong number. According to him, the Mobians' uprising has been carefully planned to coordinate with a powerful outside ally: the Star Empire of Manticore. Only ManticoreÃ¢â‚¬â€and Mike HenkeÃ¢â‚¬â€have never even heard of the Mobius Liberation Front.\n\nIt's a set up . . . and Michelle knows who's behind it. The shadowy Mesan Alignment has launched a bold move to destroy Manticore's reputation as the champion of freedom. And when the RMN doesn't arrive, when the MLF is brutally and bloodily crushed, no independent star system will ever trust Manticore again.\n\nMike Henke knows she has no orders from her government to assist any rebellions or liberation movements, that she has only so many ships, which can be in only so many places at a time . . . and that she can't possibly justify diverting any of her limited, outnumbered strength to missions of liberation the Star Empire never signed on for. She knows that . . . and she doesn't care.\n\nNo one is going to send thousands of patriots to their deaths, trusting in Manticoran help that will never come.\n\nNot on Mike Henke's watch.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e28f18a562323cb95358adc56b55e560f23514f9","amp;dn":"David+Weber+-+Shadow+of+Freedom+%28eARC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e28f18a562323cb95358adc56b55e560f23514f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,143,24,165,98,50,60,185,83,88,173,197,107,85,229,96,242,53,20,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
