In fact, stories about the Southern and Northern Dynasties of China have rarely been brought to the screen, and the producers of this series attempt to fill the void with a big-budget production that features true-to-history storylines and costume designs, and a tour-de-force performance by Taiwan actress Jacklyn Wu.\n\nAfter a successful career in movies in the 90s beginning with A Moment of Romance, the stylish actress has kept a low profile in recent years, but her unique charm still shines through in this period drama series, playing Empress Feng from her teenage years to her death at the age of 49. Feng began in the royal court as a maidservant to the crown prince, and was subsequently chosen as a concubine and then became the empress, and ultimately the Grand Empress Dowager, assuming regency over the younger emperors. During her 20-year reign, Feng introduced many reformative policies that would cement her place in the history books, and now this legendary figure is brought to life by Wu with the support of Mainland thespians Zhang Tielin, Wang Qingxiang, and Echo Shen (playing the storied female general Hua Mulan).
