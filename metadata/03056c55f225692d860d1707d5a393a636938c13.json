NFO .............\n-Malibu.Country.S01E01.720p.HDTV.X264-DIMENSION\nAired 02.11.2012\n\n&quot;Pilot&quot;\n\nReba McKenzie very publicly discovers that her \ncountry music legend husband, Bobby Gallagher, \nhas been cheating on her. Determined to get a \nfresh start and perhaps revive her own country \nmusic career, Reba packs up her sharp-tongued \nmother and two kids and drives cross country \nto live in Bobby's Malibu beach-front party \npad. Once there, gregarious and over-sharing \nneighbor Kim immediately reaches out with an \noffer to mentor Reba as she adjusts to \nSouthern California. With a new home and a \nmuch more liberal west coast set of rules, \nReba, her kids and mom welcome the change, but \nsoon realize that the open-mindedness of \nSouthern California goes much farther than \nthey'd expected. When Reba finds that trying \nto get her foot back in the music business is \ngoing to be an uphill battle, she befriends \nGeoffrey, the assistant to her record label's \npresident -- who never seems to be in the \noffice. Though overwhelmed and feeling out of \nplace, Reba realizes that, all in all, family \nis what matters most, and they must learn to \nview their new Malibu lifestyle as a chance \nfor a new beginning.\n\n18/Slower+\nEvolve... or die.\n\nEnjoy :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03056c55f225692d860d1707d5a393a636938c13","amp;dn":"Malibu.Country.S01E01.720p.HDTV.X264-DIMENSION","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03056c55f225692d860d1707d5a393a636938c13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,5,108,85,242,37,105,45,134,13,23,7,213,163,147,166,54,147,140,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
