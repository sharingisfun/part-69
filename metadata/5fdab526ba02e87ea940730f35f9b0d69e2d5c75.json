Together youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll discover expansive outdoor areas and ominous caverns; random dungeons teem with a huge variety of all new monsters and villains, powerful magical loot, and quests to complete. Journey through vastly differing locales, enjoying all new weather features, time of day events, and a new and more deeply developed story.\nBACKSTORY\n\nYears ago, the Heroes of Torchlight saved the world from the ancient evil, Ordrak. Now someone has stolen the essence of his power, and is using it to upset the balance of the six elements. After witnessing the destruction wrought by this terrible artifact, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll begin a quest to uncover the villainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s identity and avert disaster. The trail leads from the beleaguered Estherian Steppes, through the war-torn Mana Wastes and the haunted ruins of an ancient dwarven city, before descending to a realm where no mortal has set foot for thousands of yearsÃ¢â‚¬â€and where an even more terrible evil struggles to unleash itself into the world.\n\nSystem Requirements\nOS: Windows XP SP3/Vista/Windows 7\nProcessor: x86-compatible 1.4GHz or faster processor\nMemory: 1GB System RAM\nHard Disk Space: 1.2GB free space (subject to change)\nVideo Card: DirectX compatible 3D graphics card with at least 256MB of addressable memory.\nDirectXÃ‚Â®: 9.0c\n\nInstall Notes:\n\n1.Install game\n2.Play from desktop shortcut\n3.NO NEED FOR CRACK\n\nMore info and support here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.aviara.ro/forum/index.php?topic=13484.0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.aviara.ro/forum/index.php?topic=13484.0&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nIf you like this game seed it to others!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fdab526ba02e87ea940730f35f9b0d69e2d5c75","amp;dn":"Torchlight+II-%3DAviaRa%3D-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fdab526ba02e87ea940730f35f9b0d69e2d5c75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,218,181,38,186,2,232,126,169,64,115,15,53,249,176,214,158,45,92,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
