If only some parts of hardware will change, clever scheduler wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t redo all the long testing, but only tests relevant to hardware changes.\n    Distributed: due to modular architecture, Inquisitor can be easily distributed across a cluster to distribute load or make a geographically distributed system.\n    Scalable: it could be helpful to analyse/test just one home computer or all the computers in your organization, up to multiple thousands computers in manufacturing enterprise.\n    Free as in speech: the base platform is distributed under the GPL license.\n    Mature: Inquisitor is based on a rock-solid Linux technology and is under active development since 2004. There are multiple production enterprise installations relying on it.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e15df2399476f61a05e53b6017f6888019bf472","amp;dn":"Inquisitor+Linux+Live+3.1+Beta+2+64+Bit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e15df2399476f61a05e53b6017f6888019bf472","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,21,223,35,153,71,111,97,160,94,83,182,1,127,104,136,1,155,244,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
