Experience an ironic story-driven RPG with humorous dialogue-puzzles in the style of Monkey Island as well as a strategic combat system, where your party members are controlled simultaneously. Our story starts as the citizens of the Kingdom of Glory celebrate their victory over the Dark Church. While in the catacombs of their former enemies, their revelry is disturbed by a sudden all-encompassing fog. The citizens wrapped by the fog disappear screaming into nothing. Those that remain alive after the strange attack, barricade themselves in the depths of the catacombs.\n\n\n.:+:.sharedump.org.:+:.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fde53f842ce0460a38ded719770827339e28c7fe","amp;dn":"Grotesque_Tactics_2_Dungeons_and_Donuts-FLT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fde53f842ce0460a38ded719770827339e28c7fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,229,63,132,44,224,70,10,56,222,215,25,119,8,39,51,158,40,199,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
