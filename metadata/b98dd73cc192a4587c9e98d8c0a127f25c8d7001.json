Nagaiah It is a soul stirring film about the truly extraordinary life of Saint Thyagaraja.\nThe movie achieves the magic by having Nagayya sing for himself the 28 selected songs composed by Tyagaraja. The movie is a solid proof for the importance of screenplay and acting in a movie. The film is also a big credit to the skills of Nagayya - as a director, actor, singer and producer! Nagayya sang the Thyagaraja Kruthis with the devotion and clarity that is way beyond those of the more well-known Carnatic singers. Thyagaraja's music is very famous for the blend of rAgam-thAlam-pallavi and the sheer devotion for Lord Rama.\nThe captures the societal norms in the late 18th century. While many musicians used to seek the patronage of the kings, Tyagaraja was seeking the patronage of only Lord Rama. It depicts Tyagayya as not only a devotee of Lord Rama but also as a husband, brother, student and teacher.&quot;\n\nTorrent contains the movie divided into eight parts in mp4 format playable in &quot;vlc player&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b98dd73cc192a4587c9e98d8c0a127f25c8d7001","amp;dn":"Tyagayya+-+1946+Movie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b98dd73cc192a4587c9e98d8c0a127f25c8d7001","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,141,215,60,193,146,164,88,124,158,152,216,192,161,39,242,92,141,112,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
