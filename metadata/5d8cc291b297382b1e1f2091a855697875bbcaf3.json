You have never found the alarm clock you needed?\nWhy not try WakeVoice!\n\nWakeVoice can overcome the negative aspect associated to regular alarm clocks, making your morning funnier and less difficult.\n\nThe idea is simple: when the alarm rings, you just have to talk to WakeVoice to stop the alarm or activate the reminder.\n\nBut that's not all!\nOnce the ringing stopped, it's your phone's turn to talk to you.\nCustomizable messages, weather of the day, news of your choice (RSS)... choose what you want to hear.\n\nWhat's in this version : (Updated : Aug 29, 2012)\n\n    We're using a new service to give you your daily weather forecast.\n    Important : don't forget to add your country if it is not your city that is returned by the service. For instance, use &quot;New-York,USA&quot; or &quot;Paris,France&quot;.\n\nRequired Android O/S : 1.6+\n\n\n                                By bobiras2009\t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d8cc291b297382b1e1f2091a855697875bbcaf3","amp;dn":"WakeVoice+Vocal+Alarm+Clock+v4.0.3+Final+By+bobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d8cc291b297382b1e1f2091a855697875bbcaf3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,140,194,145,178,151,56,43,30,31,32,145,168,85,105,120,117,187,202,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
