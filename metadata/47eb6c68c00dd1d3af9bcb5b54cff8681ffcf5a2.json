He is in the same league as Ritwik Ghatak &amp; Mani Kaul. Many of his films explore individual traumas and tragedies against the background of collective aberrations. He has won several prizes in India.\n\nAll his movies are acclaimed and are listed below:\nAvasesh (1975)\nAnya (1975)\nGhatashradda/The Ritual (1977)\nAkramana/The Conquest (1979)\nMooru Darigalu/Three Path Ways (1981), \nTabarana Kathe/The Story of Tabara (1987)\nBannada Vesha/The Colourful Mask (1989, TV)\nMane/The Dwelling (1990), \nEk Ghar (1991)\nKraurya/The Tale of a Story Teller (1996)\nThayi Saheba (1997)\nDweepa/The Island (2002)\nHaseena (2004)\nNaayi Neralu/In the Shadow of the Dog (2006)\nGulabi Talkies (2008)\n\nSynopsis &amp; Plot of Mane:\nPossibly the most unusual Kasaravalli picture and certainly my favorite by the director, Mane (also dubbed in Hindi as Ek Ghar) is a Kafkaesque tale about a young couple (Naseeruddin Shah and Deepti Naval) that moves to the city from a village with the hope of finding privacy and freedom, which are unavailable in the joint family system. For all its narrative excursions, in a sense, Mane is merely about the breakup of a marriage in which the Rossellinian couple, unable to confront each other directly amidst the loneliness of the city, externalizes their troubles Ã¢â‚¬â€œ his powerlessness, her desire for freedom and their childlessness Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and shifts blame on situations beyond their control in order to act victims. Kasaravalli works wonder with film and sound here, using them to denote the impending break down. (One stunning shot uses the neon lights of the neighbourhood to literally break apart the frame). A critique on urban spaces that suffocate more than they promise privacy, Mane unfolds like a sociological update on Rear Window (1954), in which personal anxieties and fears are displaced onto the surroundings and, specifically, onto a lower social class. In that sense, Mane connects all the way to the directorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s latest work in the manner in which it raises questions about the visibility of the class structure and the seeming imperceptibility of the consequences of acts of one class on the other. Mane is full of such encroachments of freedom by other competing notions of freedom Ã¢â‚¬â€œ between classes, between houses and between spouses. \n\nP.S - The director felt that he could have cast Kannada actors instead of Naseer and Deepti. But the inherent strength of these performers surpasses the minor language hurdle making the film a modern classic.\n\nimdb link - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102389/\n\nCast:\nNaseeruddin Shah\nDeepti Naval\nRohini Hattangady\n\nMedia Info :\nLanguage - Kannada (Indian)\nVideo Size -  652 MB\nVideo Codec - H.264/AVC\nVideo Res - 506 x 370\nVideo Frame Rate - 29.970 fps @ 780 Kbps\nSubtitles - English (Hardsubbed)\nAudio Codec - MP3\nSample Rate - 44100 Hz @ 128 kbps\nLength - 1 hours 56 mins\n\nPosters:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/35sJb.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/35sJb.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nScreens :\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/PorQg.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/PorQg.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/OdOLl.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/OdOLl.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/av4J0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/av4J0.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/AlW6k.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/AlW6k.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/BZMZc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/BZMZc.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTakes me 5 Hours to Encode &amp; 2 Hours to Upload &amp; Months to Seed\n\nTakes me 30 Minutes to Create Description/Screen Shots etc...\n\nTakes you just 10 Seconds to say &quot;Thank You&quot;.
