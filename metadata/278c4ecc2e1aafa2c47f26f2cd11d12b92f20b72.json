Hadley (AgentParsec). It shares the same gameplay elements as the original - you must collect 8 pages while avoiding the enemy. This is not intended to be a copy - simply a way for people who loved Slender to be able to face their fear on a different map with the same awesome gameplay. There are some differences which will make playing a somewhat unique experience - different AI, new sounds, and a different environment.\n\nVersion 1.0 of 7th Street has been released.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:278c4ecc2e1aafa2c47f26f2cd11d12b92f20b72","amp;dn":"Slender+-+7th+Street+v1.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"278c4ecc2e1aafa2c47f26f2cd11d12b92f20b72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,140,78,204,46,26,175,162,196,127,38,242,205,17,209,43,146,242,11,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
