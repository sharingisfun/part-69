It focuses on how the work of Sigmund Freud, Anna Freud, and Edward Bernays influenced the way corporations and governments have analyzed,Ã¢â‚¬Â­ dealt with, and controlled Ã¢â‚¬Â¬people.\n\nPart 4: Eight People Sipping Wine in Kettering\n\nIn Episode 4 the main subjects are Philip Gould and Matthew Freud, the great grandson of Sigmund, a PR consultant. They were part of the efforts during the nineties to bring the Democrats in the US and New Labour in the United Kingdom back into power. Adam Curtis explores the psychological methods they have now massively introduced into politics. He also argues that the eventual outcome strongly resembles Edward Bernays vision for the &quot;Democracity&quot; during the 1939 New York World's Fair. It is widely believed that the series was inspired and informed by a book written by the American historian, Stuart Ewen, &quot;PR! A Social History of Spin&quot;.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe3ce08280c266da26a38fec5646ab67b8de1a1a","amp;dn":"The+Century+of+the+self+-+4of4+Eight+People+Sipping+Wine.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe3ce08280c266da26a38fec5646ab67b8de1a1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,60,224,130,128,194,102,218,38,163,143,236,86,70,171,103,184,222,26,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
