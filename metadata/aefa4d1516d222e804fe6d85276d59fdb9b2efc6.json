Kennan: An American Life\n\nWinner of the 2012 Pulitzer Prize for Biography\n\nRead by Malcolm Hillgartner, 96 kbps, Unabridged\n\nWidely and enthusiastically acclaimed, this is the authorized, definitive biography of one of the most fascinating but troubled figures of the twentieth century by the nation's leading Cold War historian. In the late 1940s, George F. KennanÃ¢â‚¬â€then a bright but, relatively obscure American diplomatÃ¢â‚¬â€wrote the &quot;long telegram&quot; and the &quot;X&quot; article. These two documents laid out United States' strategy for &quot;containing&quot; the Soviet UnionÃ¢â‚¬â€a strategy which Kennan himself questioned in later years. Based on exclusive access to Kennan and his archives, this landmark history illuminates a life that both mirrored and shaped the century it spanned.\n\nWinner of the 2011 National Book Critics Circle Award for Biography\n\nHenry A. Kissinger\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¦John Lewis GaddisÃ¢â‚¬Â¦has brought again to life the dilemmas and aspirations of those pivotal decades of the mid-20th century. His magisterial work, George F. Kennan: An American Life, bids fair to be as close to the final word as possible on one of the most important, complex, moving, challenging and exasperating American public servantsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Masterfully researched, exhaustively documented, Gaddis's moving work gives us a figure with whom, however one might differ on details, it was a privilege to be a contemporary.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€The New York Times Book Review\nPublishers Weekly\n\nNo one is better suited than Gaddis to write this authorized biography of George F. Kennan: the noted Yale cold war historian had total access to KennanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s papers as well as to his family members and associatesÃ¢â‚¬â€Kennan so trusted his biographer that he remarked, Ã¢â‚¬Å“write , if you will, on the confident assumption that no account need be taken of my own reaction... either in this world or the next.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Through his privileged relationship with Kennan, Gaddis reveals the man behind the public persona as an agonized and fragile individual who often felt alienated from the U.S. and his fellow citizens, despite his tireless service to his country. In addition to the intimacies of the work, Gaddis offers critical analyses of KennanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s key roles as diplomat, policy maker, and scholar of Russian history. Unsurpassed in his strategic vision during the cold war, Kennan is credited with being responsible for much of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eventual victory, and therein lies the impetus behind this remarkable biography. Adroitly managed (if occasionally barnacled with extraneous facts), GaddisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work is a major contribution to KennanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s legacy and the history of American foreign policy.\n\nWhat People Are Saying\nGeorge P. Shultz\n&quot;When a great historian writes about a great man, the result is bound to be outstanding. This book exceeds even that high expectation.&quot; --(George P. Shultz, author of Turmoil and Triumph: My Years as Secretary of State; former U.S. Secretary of State; Distinguished Fellow, Hoover Institution, Stanford University)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aefa4d1516d222e804fe6d85276d59fdb9b2efc6","amp;dn":"John+Gaddis+-+George+F.+Kennan+Bio+-+2012+Pulitzer+Prize","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aefa4d1516d222e804fe6d85276d59fdb9b2efc6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,250,77,21,22,210,34,232,4,254,109,133,39,109,89,253,185,178,239,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
