It is the second film in the Indiana Jones franchise and a prequel to Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981). After arriving in India, Indiana Jones is asked by a desperate village to find a mystical stone. He agrees, stumbling upon a Kali-worshipping thuggee cult practicing child slavery, black magic, and ritual human sacrifice.\n\nProducer and co-writer George Lucas decided to make the film a prequel as he did not want the Nazis to be the villains again. The original idea was to set the film in China, with a hidden valley inhabited by dinosaurs. Other rejected plot devices included the Monkey King and a haunted castle in Scotland. Lucas then wrote a film treatment that resembled the final storyline of the film. Lawrence Kasdan, Lucas's collaborator on Raiders of the Lost Ark, turned down the offer to write the script, and Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz were hired as his replacement.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:671114b68343ac8369e1567d995a58a85bdc07ee","amp;dn":"Indiana.Jones.2.and.the.Temple.of.Doom.1984.HDTV.360p.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"671114b68343ac8369e1567d995a58a85bdc07ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,17,20,182,131,67,172,131,105,225,86,125,153,90,88,168,91,220,7,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
