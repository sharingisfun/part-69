Make some beats with one of the drum machines and then move onto the bassline. Once you have finished building your sequences navigate to the overview and start switching up the patterns, add some delay or change the tempo, all in real time.\n\nEach device includes the full range of parameters which would have been found on the original machines, this coupled with the multi-touch functionality makes it possible for the user to really control each device's output signal. Audiotool Sketch is built around the same audio engine as Audiotool and outputs full power audio.\n\nMinimum requirements:\n- Android 3.0\n- Dual-Core CPU\n\nAny tablet that shipped with Honeycomb should have no problem running Audiotool Sketch. The only phone which is currently capable of running the app is the Galaxy Nexus.\n\n\n                                By bobiras2009\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d406a9fb6533c65bde1d5635b38b1591b0098bae","amp;dn":"Audiotool+Sketch+v1.0+By+bobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d406a9fb6533c65bde1d5635b38b1591b0098bae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,6,169,251,101,51,198,91,222,29,86,53,179,139,21,145,176,9,139,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
