This does not appear to be available on DVD, but it is an entertaining and unusual adaptation of a classic story.\n\n1 hr 36 min\n\nDirected by \nNigel Finch    \n  \nWriters\nHeinrich Marschner   (opera 1827)\nWilhelm August Wohlbruck   (opera libretto 1827)\nCharles Hart   (words 1992)\n\nAdapted from \nLord Byron   story &quot;The Vampyr&quot; \nJohn Polidori   story \n\nDer Vampyr (The Vampire) is a Romantic opera in two acts by Heinrich Marschner. The German libretto by Wilhelm August WohlbrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ck (Marschner's brother-in-law) is based on the play Der Vampir oder die Totenbraut (1821) by Heinrich Ludwig Ritter, which itself was based on the short novel The Vampyre (1819) by John Polidori. The first performance took place on 29 March 1828 in Leipzig, where it was a hit.\n\nThe opera is still occasionally performed, and, in 1992, an updated adaptation, entitled The Vampyr: A Soap Opera, with new lyrics by Charles Hart, starring Omar Ebrahim and produced by Janet Street-Porter, was serialised on BBC television.\n\nThe Vampyr: A Soap Opera is a miniseries based on Heinrich Marschner's opera Der Vampyr. It first aired on BBC 2 on December 2, 1992. The new English libretto was written by Charles Hart, based on a story by Janet Street-Porter and Nigel Finch, which was based on the original libretto by Wilhelm August WohlbrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ck, which was based on John Polidori's short story &quot;The Vampyre.&quot; It was conducted by David Parry and directed by Nigel Finch.\n\nAlthough the libretto of The Vampyr is based on that of Der Vampyr, there have been numerous changes because of the modernization of the plot and the constraints of the miniseries form. Almost every choral number has been cut. The characters' relationships have been changed: for example, Berkeley becomes Ginny's lover rather than her father, and Emma is no longer engaged to George. Alex's aria is relocated from the second act to the first act, after he finds Ripley's body, and George sings Alex's part in the first half of the Act II finale. The drinking quintet, in which Suse Blunt scolds her husband and his friends for drinking, becomes a friendly scene between co-workers at a car wash.\n\n Omar Ebrahim ...
