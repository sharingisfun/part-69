Set in a summer villa, the story is tautly structured, taking place over a single week in which a group of beautiful, flawed tourists in the French Riviera come loose at the seams. Deborah Levy's writing combines linguistic virtuosity, technical brilliance and a strong sense of what it means to be alive. Swimming Home represents a new direction for a major writer. In this book, the wildness and the danger are all the more powerful for resting just beneath the surface. With its deep psychology, biting humour and deceptively light surface, it wears its darkness lightly.\n\n\n                             Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                             Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n\n          **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ef1595f2b16f4bffa7249f5b7e9e500eedacc87","amp;dn":"Swimming+Home+by+Deborah+Levy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ef1595f2b16f4bffa7249f5b7e9e500eedacc87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,241,89,95,43,22,244,191,250,114,73,245,183,233,229,0,238,218,204,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
