Obama finishes his college studies at Columbia, where the film claims he is influenced by anti-colonialist figures. His progression into an intellectual is highlighted by a visit to Kenya. The film incorporates spoken words from ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s audio book, Dreams from My Father.DÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Souza discusses ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s father, Barack Obama, Sr., and what DÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Souza describes as Obama Sr.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s anti-colonialist views of the British Empire.
