This musically and emotionally intense work is\n    Hoobastank s initial release on Open E Entertainment following a productive\n    decade on Island Records during which they ruled the modern rock charts,\n    crossed over big-time with the iconic smash The Reason and sold 10 million\n    albums.\n\n________\nenjoy &amp; seed.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b9f0f00dcc1d9be69f195390219adc7c25c40ee","amp;dn":"Hoobastank-Fight_Or_Flight-2012-MTD+%2ANEW%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b9f0f00dcc1d9be69f195390219adc7c25c40ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,159,15,0,220,193,217,190,105,241,149,57,2,25,173,199,194,92,64,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
