This eye, which he usually hides behind a contact lens, gives him the ability to see ghosts and spirits and has brought him many hardships throughout his life. Even though this special vision could easily scare anyone, it doesn't scare Yakumo. He strongly believes ghosts and spirits have feelings left behind, bound to earth because of a certain 'cause'. It is his opinion that by talking with them, he can eliminate that 'cause' and release them, allowing them to rest in peace. One day, a fellow College student named Haruka Ozawa knocks on his door, asking for help to save her friend, who she believes to be possessed. Reluctantly, he accepts, and thus begins a story full of unsolved supernatural events, bound to be deciphered by the two, and Yakumo's journey to release his heart from his painful past.\n-----\n\n\nThank you for downloading :)\nEnjoy watching and please seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5324a80b38e1b957e1d4bb20d09f2d321cdc520","amp;dn":"Psychic+Detective+Yakumo+%28Complete+Ep+1-13%29+480p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5324a80b38e1b957e1d4bb20d09f2d321cdc520","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,50,74,128,179,142,27,149,126,29,75,178,13,9,242,211,33,205,197,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
