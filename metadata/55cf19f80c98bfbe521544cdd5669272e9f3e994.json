Michael Straczynski\n\nPencils and Inks by Colleen Doran\n\nColors by Dan Brown\n\nThe Book of Lost Souls was an American comic book series published under the Icon Comics imprint, owned by Marvel Comics. It was written by J. Michael Straczynski and pencilled by Colleen Doran.\n\nThe comic follows Jonathan, a man who lived over a century ago who was transported to the 21st century during an attempted suicide. His new life involves supernatural mysteries and enigmatic characters such as a talking cat named Mystery and the Dark Man, whose plans for Jonathan are unclear. Jonathan is given the power to &quot;save&quot; the Lost, those individuals who have lost all hope in their lives.\n\nThe Dark Man may be God or the Devil, and it is, as yet, unclear which one he may be. An individual the Dark Man wants saved may be working for either, depending on your point of view.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55cf19f80c98bfbe521544cdd5669272e9f3e994","amp;dn":"The+Book+of+Lost+Souls+%28Request%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55cf19f80c98bfbe521544cdd5669272e9f3e994","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,207,25,248,12,152,191,190,82,21,68,205,213,102,146,114,233,243,233,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
