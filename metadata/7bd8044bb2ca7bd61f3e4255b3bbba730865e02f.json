George (Freddie Highmore) isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t what youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d call a people person, yet heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s somehow managed to make it through high school with a minimal amount of effort. Meanwhile, Sally (Emma Roberts) is a natural-born beauty whose popularity helps to hide the fact that sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s positively miserable at home. Brought together by their turbulent personal lives, Sally and George quickly discover that despite appearances, they actually have quite a bit in common. It all threatens to fall apart, though, when George learns that he may not be eligible for graduation. Desperate to escape high school by any means necessary, George attempts to learn some measure of self-discipline by working under Dustin, a successful 25-year-old artist who sees potential in the young misfit. Now, just as George begins to see the future as something to embrace rather than something to dread, his lazy past threatens to hinder his forward momentum.\n\nGenre: Drama\nIMDB rating: 6.2/10\nDirected by: Gavin Wiesen\nStarring: Freddie Highmore, Emma Roberts and Michael Angarano\n\nRelease Name: The.Art.of.Getting.By.2011.LIMITED.DVDRip.XviD-AMIABLE\nSize: 1 CD (700 MB)\nQuality: 608ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€256, ~1,000 kbps, MP3 128 kbps\nRuntime: 83 mins ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7bd8044bb2ca7bd61f3e4255b3bbba730865e02f","amp;dn":"The.Art.of.Getting.By.2011.LIMITED.DVDRip.XviD-AMIABLE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7bd8044bb2ca7bd61f3e4255b3bbba730865e02f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,216,4,75,178,202,123,214,31,62,66,85,179,187,186,115,8,101,224,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
